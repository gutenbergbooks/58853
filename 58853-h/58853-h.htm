<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>My lamented friend Dr. Badham having died since the first
publication of this work, my advice was asked upon the subject
of the preparation of a new edition. It was wished that
the text of the work should be altered as little as possible, and
that the price of the book should be materially lessened. The
latter object could not be effected without reducing the number
of the Plates; but it appeared to me that some plates relating
to details of structure might very well be omitted, as
well as the figures of a few Italian species which, although
interesting in themselves, are quite unnecessary in a book on
British Esculent Fungi. With the exception of the omission
of the description of these latter species, and the addition of
the description of two other species hereafter referred to, the
alterations in the text are too trifling to require notice. With
regard to the Figures in this edition, most of them are those
of the former plates, somewhat reduced; a few have been taken
from the plates of Mr. Berkeley’s ‘Outlines of British Fungology,’
and a few from original and other sources.</p>

<p>By a re-arrangement of the whole, the reduction in the
number of the Plates has been effected, and, at the same time,
figures of all the Fungi represented in the first edition have
been given, as well as of two other species not there noticed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
I should observe, however, that by a mistake of the artist an
extra figure of the Horse Mushroom has been inserted in
Plate IV. instead of one of the Common Mushroom.</p>

<p>The two species above alluded to which were not figured in
the first edition, are <i>Tuber æstivum</i> and <i>Helvella esculenta</i>.
The former must have been inadvertently omitted by Dr. Badham,
as it has long been known as abundant in certain parts
of England. <i>Helvella esculenta</i>, although alluded to by Dr.
Badham, was not at that time known to be a British species.
It has since been observed near Weybridge in Surrey, where
it occurs almost every spring. The plant figured in Pl. XV.
fig. 6 of the first edition under the name of <i>Lycoperdon plumbeum</i>,
is not that species, but <i>Lycoperdon pyriforme</i>; it will
be found at <a href="#plate8">Pl. VIII. fig. 5</a>. Dr. Badham states that all puff-balls
are esculent, but, judging from the smell of <i>Lycoperdon
pyriforme</i>, I should much doubt whether it would make an
agreeable dish. <i>Lycoperdon plumbeum</i> is now better known as
<i>Bovista plumbea</i>, and <i>Lycoperdon Bovista</i> as <i>Lycoperdon giganteum</i>.</p>

<p>There is some confusion about the synonymy of the plants
described by Dr. Badham as <i>Agaricus prunulus</i> and <i>Ag. exquisitus</i>.
It is unnecessary to discuss the matter here, and I
have thought it not desirable under the circumstances to alter
Dr. Badham’s nomenclature. They appear to be described in
Mr. Berkeley’s work as <i>Ag. gambosus</i>, Fr., and <i>Ag. arvensis</i>,
Schœff.</p>

<p>Dr. Badham’s observations on the spores of Fungi must be
read in connection with the note added by him at the conclusion
of the work; and to those who are interested in that part
of the subject I should recommend the perusal of the seventh
chapter of Mr. Berkeley’s ‘Outlines of British Fungology,’ and
Tulasne’s recent work, ‘Selecta Fungorum Carpologia.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cooke, in his ‘Plain and Easy Account of British
Fungi,’ recently published, mentions some species as esculent
which are not noticed in this work. I have however no experience
of their qualities, and must refer the reader to Mr.
Cooke’s book for further information. He mentions Mr.
Berkeley as an authority for considering <i>Agaricus rubescens</i>
as suspicious; but, from long experience, I can vouch for its
being not only wholesome, but, as Dr. Badham says, “a very
delicate fungus.”</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p class="center">TO THE RIGHT REVEREND
THE LORD BISHOP OF NORWICH.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I had two reasons for desiring that this humble performance
should appear under the sanction of your Lordship’s
name. Nothing could be more favourable to a Treatise on
any department of Natural History, than the approval of one
who has been so eminently successful in his cultivation of the
same field.</p>

<p>But it is with much greater confidence that I dedicate a
work, whose chief object it is to furnish the labouring classes
with wholesome nourishment and profitable occupation, to a
high functionary of that kingdom, which is distinguished
from all others by recognizing the claims and furthering the
interests of the poor.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, my Lord,</p>

<p class="center">With great respect, your Lordship’s</p>

<p class="center">Obliged and humble Servant,</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE.</h2>

<p>No country is perhaps richer in esculent Funguses than our
own; we have upwards of thirty species abounding in our
woods. No markets might therefore be better supplied than
the English, and yet England is the only country in Europe
where this important and savoury food is, from ignorance or
prejudice, left to perish ungathered.</p>

<p>In France, Germany, and Italy, Funguses not only constitute
for weeks together the sole diet of thousands, but the residue,
either fresh, dried, or variously preserved in oil, vinegar,
or brine, is sold by the poor, and forms a valuable source of
income to many who have no other produce to bring into the
market. Well, then, may we style them, with M. Roques,
“<i>the manna of the poor</i>.” To call attention to an article of
commerce elsewhere so lucrative, with us so wholly neglected,
is the object of the present work, to which the best possible
introduction will be a brief reference to the state of the
fungus market abroad.</p>

<p>The following brief summary was drawn up by Professor
Sanguinetti, the Official Inspector (“<i>Ispettore dei Funghi</i>”)
at Rome; let it speak for itself:—“For forty days during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
autumn, and for about half that period every spring, large
quantities of Funguses, picked in the immediate vicinity of
Rome, from Frascati, Rocca di Papa, Albano, beyond Monte
Mario towards Ostia and the neighbourhood of the sites of
Veii and Gabii, are brought in at the different gates. In the
year 1837, the Government instituted the so-called <i>Congregazione
Speciale di Sanità</i>, which, among other duties, was
more particularly required to take into serious consideration
the commerce of Funguses, from the unrestricted sale of which
during some years past, cases of poisoning had not unfrequently
occurred. The following decisions were arrived at by
this body:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1st. That for the future an ‘Inspector of Funguses,’ versed in botany,
should be appointed to attend the market in place of the peasant, whose supposed
practical knowledge had been hitherto held as sufficient guarantee for the
public safety.</p>

<p>“2nd. That all the Funguses brought into Rome by the different gates
should be registered, under the surveillance of the principal officer, in whose
presence also the baskets were to be sealed up, and the whole for that day’s
consumption sent under escort to a central depôt.</p>

<p>“3rd. That a certain spot should be fixed upon for the Fungus market, and
that nobody, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, should hawk them about
the streets.</p>

<p>“4th. That at seven o’clock <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> precisely, the Inspector should pay his
daily visit and examine the whole, the contents of the baskets being previously
emptied on the ground by the proprietors, who were then to receive, if the
Funguses were approved of, a printed permission of sale from the police, and
to pay for it an impost of one baioccho (a halfpenny) on every ten pounds.</p>

<p>“5th. That quantities under ten pounds should not be taxed.</p>

<p>“6th. That the stale funguses of the preceding day, as well as those that
were mouldy, bruised, filled with maggots, or dangerous (<i>muffi</i>, <i>guasti</i>, <i>verminosi</i>,
<i>velenosi</i>), together with any specimen of the common mushroom (<i>Ag.
campestris</i>) detected in any of the baskets, should be sent under escort and
thrown into the Tiber.</p>

<p>“7th. That the Inspector should be empowered to fine or imprison all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
refractory to the above regulations; and, finally, that he should furnish a weekly
report to the Tribunal of Provisions (<i>Il Tribunale delle Grascie</i>) of the proceeds
of the sale.</p>

</div>

<p>“As all fresh Funguses for sale in quantities <i>exceeding</i> ten
pounds are weighed, in order to be taxed, we are enabled to
arrive at an exact estimate of the number of pounds thus
disposed of. The return of <i>taxed</i> Mushrooms in the city
of Rome during the last ten years, gives a yearly average of
between <i>sixty and eighty thousand pounds</i> weight; and if we
double this amount, as we may safely do, in order to include
such smaller <i>untaxed</i> supplies as are disposed of as bribes,
fees, and presents, and reckon the whole at the rate of six
baiocchi, or threepence per pound (a fair average), this will
make the commercial value of fresh Funguses very apparent,
showing it here to be little less than £2000 a year.”</p>

<p>But the fresh Funguses form only a small part of the
whole consumption, to which must be added the dried, the
pickled, and the preserved; which sell at a much higher
price than the first.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Supposing, however, that with these additions
the supply of all kinds only reached a sum the double
of that given above, even this would furnish us with an annual
average of nearly <i>four thousand pounds sterling</i>; and this
in a single city, and that, too, by no means the most populous
one in Italy!<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> What, then, must be the net receipts of all
the market-places of all the Italian States? For as in these
the proportion of the price of esculent Funguses to butchers’
meat is as two to three, it is plain that prejudice has deprived
the poor of this country, not only of many thousand pounds
of the former but also of as much of the latter, as might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
been purchased by exchange, and of the countless sums which
might have been earned in gathering them.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h2 id="heading1">ETYMOLOGIES.</h2>

<p>By the word μύκης, ητος or ου, ὁ, whereof the usually received
root, μῦκος (<i>mucus</i>), is probably factitious, the Greeks
used familiarly to designate certain, but indefinite species of
funguses, which they were in the habit of employing at table.
This term, in its origin at once trivial and restricted to at
most a few varieties, has become in our days classical and
generic; Mycology, its direct derivative, including, in the
language of modern botany, several great sections of plants
(many amongst the number of microscopic minuteness), which
have apparently as little to do with the original import of
μύκης as smut, bunt, mould, or dry-rot, have to do with our
table mushrooms. A like indefiniteness formerly characterized
the Latin word <i>fungus</i>, though it be now used in as
catholic a sense as that of μύκης; this, in the classic times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of Rome, seems to have been confined (without any precise
limitation, however) to certain sorts which might be eaten,
and to others which it was not safe to eat. The</p>

<p class="noindent">of Martial, points to an inferior kind, but still esculent;
whilst the word not unfrequently designated, if not actual
toadstools, at least very equivocal mushrooms; of which
character were those “ancipites fungi” presented by Veiento
to his poor clients. Some melancholy etymologists, upon
whom good mushrooms are really thrown away, would beget
fungus out of <i>funus</i>, but Voss<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> judiciously rejects so harsh
and forced a derivation, mentioning together with it others
that are still more so.</p>

<p>The word <i>Boletus</i>, which now stands for a large genus of
the section <i>Pileati</i>, was used in ancient Rome to designate
that particular mushroom which had the honour, under Agrippina’s
orders and Locusta’s cookery, of poisoning Claudius;
in memory of which event it is now called <i>Amanita Cæsarea</i>,
the Cæsar’s mushroom. It occurs frequently both in the
poets and prose writers of those days, and was in high
esteem, as we collect from Pliny, who, though no mushroom-fancier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
himself, calls this “Boletus optimi cibi.” Nero, in
playful allusion to his uncle’s death, of which it was the occasion,
designates it the ‘food of gods,’ βρῶμα θεῶν; and Martial
celebrates it in many a convivial epigram; in one, for
instance, where he asks his hard-hearted patron, “what
possible pleasure it can be for his guests to sit at his table,
and see him devour boletuses;” in another, “gold and silver
and dresses may be trusted to a messenger, but not a boletus,
(<i>subaudi</i>) because he will eat it on the way.” This is the
only ancient mushroom which we at once recognize by the
description of it; “it originates,” says Pliny, “in a volva, or
purse, in which it lies at first concealed as in an egg;
breaking through this, it rises upwards on its stalk; the
colour of its cap is red; it takes a week to pass through the
various stages of its growth and declension.” The <i>suillus</i>—probably
the same as the modern <i>porcino</i> (a word of analogous
import), which was, and is, eaten by men as well as pigs, and
not always by these<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—was, according to Pliny, the fungus
which most readily lent itself to poisoning by mistake; a
remark so far consonant to modern experience, that it is
liable, without some attention, to be confounded with the
<i>Boletus luridus</i>, <i>B. cyanescens</i>, and others, which in their general
shape and external hue resemble it, though it is not by
any means certain that any of these species, with which it
may be confounded, are themselves poisonous.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The word
<i>tuber</i>, though it occasionally (as in Juvenal) meant the <i>truffle</i>,
seems to have been used with considerable latitude. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the <i>tubers</i> said to spring up after those <i>optatos imbres</i>, those
“long-wished-for showers of spring,” were, probably, not
truffles, but puff-balls, which, at the season of warm rains
grow with incredible rapidity, forming an esteemed article of
luxury, not only in Italy, but also in India; whereas the
truffle never makes its appearance in the markets at such
times, nor comes up so immediately after rain. <i>Tuber</i>, like
our ancient “<i>fusseball</i>,” seems a common appellation both
for truffles and puff-balls. What the ancients understood by
<i>hydnum</i> is as little precise or discriminate as the last word;
for Theophrastus declares it to have a light bark, λειόφλοιον
εἶναι, in which case it is a puff-ball, while the plant called
ὑδνοφίλον, which is said to indicate the whereabouts of <i>hydna</i>
in its neighbourhood, can only refer to the truffle. The
truffle, however, which is now so much prized throughout
Europe, seems not to have been known to the ancients, at
least it is not described by them.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> That which the Greeks
called <i>misy</i>, and the Romans the Libyan truffle,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was white
and of very delicious flavour, whilst by <i>hydnum</i> (when this
word really meant truffle) they usually designated a particular
kind bearing a smooth red rind, and abounding in certain
districts of Italy; but having no chance against the black,
nodulated <i>tuber tuberum</i>, the truffle <i>par excellence</i>, found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
such abundance in the vicinities of Rome, Florence, Siena,
etc., and, above all, amongst the Nursian hills of Umbria,
over against Spoleto, whence it is largely exported throughout
and beyond Italy. Under the name <i>Peziza</i>, the ancients
appear at times to describe, unconsciously, a <i>Scleroderma</i> or
species of puff-ball after it has evacuated its seed, when it
presents a flattened surface, and so far looks like a <i>Peziza</i>,
with which, in fact, it has no connection. By <i>Amanita</i>,
Galen intended some kind of esculent fungus, but we know
not which; this word has now come to have a more extensive
import, and to designate, besides one or two species that are
good, many of the most dangerous character. Whatever the
ancient <i>Amanita</i> may have been, it was formerly in high
repute; Galen declares that, next to the <i>Boletus</i>, it is ἀβλαβέστατον
to eat—in which good report of it he is abundantly
borne out by the concurrent testimony of Nicander. What
Dioscorides meant by ἀγαρικὸν is another uncertainty, to
resolve which we have not sufficient data; one thing seems
plain, that it could not have been our officinal <i>Agaric</i>, for
that grows upon the <i>Larch</i>, whereas his <i>Agaricon</i> grew upon
the <i>Cedar</i>. Julius Scaliger amuses himself at the expense of
Athenæus for saying that <i>Agaricus</i> is so called from the
country of Agaria, whence he would make out that it originally
came; whereas there never was such a country, his
Agaria being, like our Poiatia, only another synonym for
Fancy’s fairyland.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The words <i>champignon</i> and <i>mushroom</i> have both a French
origin, though, like the corresponding derivatives from the
Greek and Latin, they too have come to signify things
different from what they originally designated; <i>champignon</i>,
for example, of which <i>champ</i> would seem to be the root, is
<i>generic</i> in France. The ‘Traités sur les Champignons’ of
Bulliard, Persoon, Paulet, Cordier, and Roques, are treatises
of funguses <i>in genere</i>; whilst in England we restrict the word
<i>champignon</i> to one small Agaric, which, as it grows in the
so-called “fairy-rings,” is hence named <i>Ag. oreades</i>. Again,
there can be no doubt that our word <i>mushroom</i> (which, as
contradistinguished from <i>toadstool</i>, is so far generic) comes
from the French <i>mouceron</i> (originally spelt <i>mousseron</i>), and
belongs of right to that most dainty of funguses, the <i>A.
prunulus</i>, which grows amidst tender herbage and <i>moss</i>
(whence its name), and which is justly considered, over almost
the whole continent of Europe, as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of culinary
<i>friandise</i>. It abounds in various parts of England, being
everywhere trodden underfoot, or reaped down, or dug up as
a nuisance, while the rings which it so sedulously forms are
as sedulously destroyed. The very odour which it exhales
under these injuries, which the French call “un parfum exquis
aromatisé,”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the Italians, “un odore gratissimo,”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is in
England occasionally cited to its disadvantage in confirmation
of its supposed noxious qualities. Thus, while we use the
word <i>mushroom</i>, which is the proper appellation of <i>this</i> species,
for another (very good, no doubt, but wholly unlike it in its
botanical characters, flavour, and appearance), this neglected,
and ignorantly neglected, species, finds itself deprived of its
rightful name, and proscribed as a toadstool. The origin of
this last word, <i>toadstool</i>, which makes them seats or thrones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for toads, does not quite satisfy me, I confess, though there
be doughty authorities for it in Johnson’s Dictionary and in
Spenser’s ‘Faery Queen’!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

Germany, they have actually been seen sitting on their
stools,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> still, even in Germany, it must be admitted that
they do not use them as frequently as we might expect, had
they been created for this end. In that most grisly and
ghastly waxwork exhibition at Florence, representing a
charnel-house filled with the recent victims to a raging plague,
in every stage of decomposition, the toad and his stool are
not forgotten; but the artist, who had here to deal with matter,
and to consult what it would bear, has not put his toads
upon these brittle stools, lest, giving way, both should come
to the ground; he has been content to convert them into
toad-umbrellas, and to spread them as an awning over their
heads.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

we now employ the term, is immense. Merely catalogued and
described, there are sufficient to fill an octavo volume of nearly
400 pages of close print, of British species alone; altogether,
there cannot be less than 5000 recognized species at present
known, and each year adds new ones to the list. The reader’s
surprise at this will somewhat diminish, when he considers,
that not only the toadstools which beset his walks, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
growing upon the ground or at the roots of trees, belong to
this class, but that the immense hordes of parasites which
feed at his expense, and foul, like the Harpies, whatever they
may not actually consume, belong to it also.</p>

<p>For the single mushroom that we eat, how many hundreds
there be that retaliate and prey upon us in return! To
enumerate but a few, and these of the microscopic kinds (on
the other side are some which the arms can scarcely embrace):
the <i>Mucor mucedo</i>, that spawns upon our dried preserves;
the <i>Ascophora mucedo</i>, that makes our bread mouldy
(“mucidæ frustra farinæ”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>); the <i>Uredo segetum</i>, that burns
Ceres out of her own cornfields; the <i>Uredo rubigo</i>, whose rust
is still more destructive; and the <i>Puccinia graminis</i>, whose
voracity sets corn-laws and farmers at defiance, are all funguses!
So is the grey <i>Monilia</i>, that rots, and then fattens
upon, our fruits; and the <i>Mucor herbariorum</i>, that destroys
the careful gleanings of the painstaking botanist. When our
beer becomes mothery, the mother of that mischief is a
fungus. If pickles acquire a bad taste, if ketchup turns ropy
and putrifies, funguses have a finger in it all! Their reign
stops not here; they prey upon each other; they even select
their victims! There is the <i>Myrothecium viride</i>, which will
only grow upon dry Agarics, preferring chiefly, for this purpose,
the <i>Agaricus adustus</i>; the <i>Mucor<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> chrysospermus</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
attacks the flesh of a particular <i>Boletus</i>; the <i>Sclerotium cornutum</i>,
which visits some other moist mushrooms in decay.
There are some <i>Xylomas</i> that will spot the leaves of the
Maple, and some those of the Willow, exclusively. The naked
seeds of some are found burrowing between the opposite surface
of leaves; some love the neighbourhood of burnt stubble
and charred wood; some visit the sculptor in his studio,
growing up amidst the heaps of moistened marble dust that
have caked and consolidated under his saw. The <i>Racodium</i>
of the low cellar<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> festoons its ceiling, shags its walls, and
wraps its thick coat round our wine-casks,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> keeping our oldest
wine in closest bond; while the <i>Geastrum</i>, aspiring occasionally
to leave this earth, has been found suspended, like Mahomet’s
coffin, between it and the stars, on the very highest
pinnacle of St. Paul’s.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The close cavities of nuts occasionally
afford concealment to some species; others, like leeches,
stick to the bulbs of plants, and suck them dry; these (the
architect’s and ship-builder’s bane) pick timber to pieces, as
men pick oakum; nor do they confine their selective ravages
to plants alone, they attach themselves to animal structures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and destroy animal life; the <i>Onygena equina</i> has a particular
fancy for the hoofs of horses and for the horns of cattle,
sticking to these alone; the belly of a tropical fly<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is liable, in
autumn, to break out into vegetable tufts of fungous growth,
and the caterpillar to carry about on his body a <i>Cordyceps</i>
larger than himself. The disease called Muscadine, which
destroys so many silkworms, is also a fungus (<i>Botrytis Bassiana</i>),
which in a very short time completely fills the worm
with filaments very unlike those it is in the habit of secreting.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The vegetating wasp,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> too, of which everybody has heard, is
only another mysterious blending of vegetable with insect life.
Lastly, and to take breath, funguses visit the wards of our
hospitals, and grow out of the products of surgical disease.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Where, then, are they not to be found? do they not abound,
like Pharaoh’s plagues, everywhere? is not their name legion,
and their province ubiquity?<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h2 id="heading3">OF THEIR GENERAL FORMS, COLOURS, TEXTURE, TASTES,
SMELLS, ETC.</h2>

<p>What geometry shall define their ever-varying shapes?
who but a Venetian painter do justice to their colours?<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
what modifications of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ convey an adequate
knowledge of all their various crases and consistencies? As
to shapes, some are simple threads, like the <i>Byssus</i>, and
never get beyond this; some shoot out into branches, like
seaweed; some puff themselves out into puff-balls; some
thrust their heads into mitres;<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> these assume the shape of
a cup,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and those of a wine-funnel;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> some, like <i>A. mammosus</i>,
have a teat; others, like the <i>A. clypeolarius</i>, are umbonated
at their centre; these are stilted upon a high leg,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and those have not a leg to stand on; some are shell-shaped,
many bell-shaped, and some hang upon their stalks like a
lawyer’s wig;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> some assume the form of the horse’s hoof,
others of a goat’s beard: in <i>Clathrus cancellatus</i> you look into
the fungus through a thick red trellis which surrounds it.
Some exhibit a nest in which they rear their young,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and, not
to speak of those vague shapes,</p>

<p class="noindent">of such tree parasites as are fain to mould themselves at the
will of their entertainer (the fate of parasites, whether under
oak or mahogany), mention may be made of two, of which
the forms are at once singular and constant; one exactly like
an ear, and given for some good reason to Judas (<i>Auricula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Judæ</i>), clings to several trees, and trembles when you touch
it; the other, which lolls out from the bark of chestnut-trees
(<i>Lingua di Castagna</i>), is so like a tongue in shape and general
appearance,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that in the days of enchanted trees you would
not have cut it off to pickle or to eat on any account, lest the
knight to whom it belonged should afterwards come to claim
it of you. The above are amongst the most remarkable of
the many Protean forms assumed by funguses; as to their
colours, we find in one genus only species which correspond
to every hue! The <i>Agaricus Cæsareus</i>, the <i>A. muscarius</i>, the
<i>A. sanguineus</i>, assume the imperial purple, the <i>A. violaceus</i>
a beautiful violet, the <i>A. sulphureus</i> a bright yellow, the <i>A.
adustus</i> a dingy black, the <i>A. exquisitus</i>, and many others,
a milk-white; whilst the <i>A. virescens</i> takes that which, in
this class of plants, is the rarest of all to meet with, a pale-green
colour. The upper surface of some is zoned with concentric
circles of different hues; sometimes it is spotted, at
other times of a uniform tint. The bonnets of some shine
as if they were sprinkled with <i>mica</i>;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> these have a rich velvety,
those a smooth kid-like covering stretched over them.
Some <i>pilei</i> are imbricated with brown scales, some flocked
with white shreds of membrane, and some are stained with
various-coloured milks secreted from within. The consistence
of funguses is very different according to their sort, and the
epithets of woody, corky, leathery, spongy, fleshy, gelatinous,
pulpy, or mucous, will all find fitting application to some of
them. Occasionally a fungus is secreted soft, but hardens by
degrees into a compact and woody texture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="heading4">ODOURS AND TASTES.</h2>

<p>Both one and the other are far more numerous in this class
of plants than in any other with which we are acquainted. As
to odours, though these be generally most powerful in the
fresh condition of the fungus, they are sometimes increased
by drying it, during which process too some species, inodorous
before, acquire an odour, and not always a pleasant one. Some
yield an insupportable stench; the <i>Phallus impudicus</i> and
<i>Clathrus cancellatus</i> are of this kind. A botanist had by mistake
taken one of the former into his bedroom; he was soon
awakened by an intolerable fœtor, and was glad to open his
window and get rid of it, as he hoped, and the <i>Phallus</i> together.
Here he was disappointed; “sublatâ causâ non tollitur
effectus,” the fœtor remaining nearly the same for some hours
afterwards. A lady, a friend of mine, who was drawing one
in a room, was obliged to take it into the open air to complete
her sketch. As to the <i>Clathrus</i>, I have found ten minutes
in a room with it nine too many: it becomes insupportably
offensive in a short time, and its infective stench has given
rise to a superstition entertained of it throughout the Landes,
viz. that it is capable of producing cancer—in consequence of
which superstition the inhabitants, who call it Cancrou, or
Cancer, cover it carefully over, lest by accident some one
should chance to touch it, and become infected with that
horrible disease in consequence.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Batsch has described an
Agaric<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of so powerful and peculiar a smell, that before he
could finish his picture (for he was drawing it) a violent headache
made him desist, “vehementi afficiebar capitis dolore.”
Of the others, some are graveolent in a savoury or in an unsavoury
sense. This smells strong of onions,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
cinnamon,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> from which it takes its name; the <i>A. ostreatus</i> (<i>auct.
nost.</i>) most powerfully of Tarragon; <i>A. odoratus</i>, and the <i>Cantharellus</i>,
like apricots and ratafia (Purton); <i>Boletus salicinus</i>,
“like the bloom of May” (Abbott); the <i>A. sanguineus</i>, when
dry, savours of a stale poultice; <i>A. piperatus</i>, of the <i>Triglia</i>,
or red mullet; the <i>Hydna</i> generally give out a smell of tallow;
moulds have their own smells, which are mouldy and musty;
some exhale the smell of putrid meat, many the odour of
fresh meal; the spawn of <i>A. prunulus</i> and of the puff-balls
(<i>Lycoperdons</i>) exhale an odour similar to the perfect plants;
but the <i>Pietra funghaia</i>, filled with the spores of its own <i>Polyporus</i>,
is without smell. When fresh, there is scarcely any
perceptible odour in <i>Boletus edulis</i> or <i>B. luridus</i>, nor yet in
the <i>A. Cæsareus</i> when recently gathered. A word about
their tastes will suffice: with so many smells, they must needs
have flavours to correspond, and so they have; sapid, sweet,
sour, peppery, rich, rank, acrid, nauseous, bitter, styptic, might
be all found in an English “gradus” (though at present, I
am sorry to say, without any lines from poets in whose
writings they occur), after the word ‘Fungus.’ In a few,
generally of an unsafe character, there is little or no taste in
the mouth while they are being masticated, but shortly after
deglutition, the fauces become dry, and a sense of more or less
constriction is apt to supervene, which frequently continues
for some time afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="heading5">EXPANSIVE POWER OF GROWTH.</h2>

<p>Soft and yielding as vegetable structures appear to the
touch, the expansive force of their growth is almost beyond
calculation. The effects of this power, of which the experience
of every one will furnish him with some instances, are perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
nowhere more strikingly exemplified than amidst the ruins of
its own creation. Coeval with many old brick fabrics of earlier
times, perhaps embedded in the very mortar which holds them
together, it may lurk there for centuries in quiescence, till
once arousing its energies, it continues to exert them in ceaseless
activity ever after. It has at Rome planted its pink
Valerians on her highest towers, and its wild fig-tree in the
breaches of her walls; nor are the granite obelisks of her
piazzas, nor the classic groups in marble on her Quirinal
mount, entirely exempt from its encroachments. A conspiracy
of plants, <i>one hundred strong</i>, have long ago planned
the destruction of the Coliseum; their undermining process
advances each year, and neither iron nor new brickwork can
arrest it long. That old Roman cement, which the barbarians
gave up as impracticable, and the pickaxe of the Barberini
had but begun to disintegrate, will, ere the lapse of another
century, be effectually pulled to pieces by the rending arm of
vegetation. Here, as erst in Juvenal’s time, the <i>mala ficus</i>
finds no walls too strong to rive asunder, no tower beyond the
reach of its scaling, no monument too sacred for it to touch.
In the class of plants immediately under consideration, while
the expansive effort of growth is equal to what it is in other
cases, its effects are far more startling from their suddenness.
M. Bulliard (to cite one or two instances out of a great
many) relates, that on placing a <i>Phallus impudicus</i> within a
glass vessel, the plant expanded so rapidly as to shiver its
sides with an explosive detonation as loud as that of a pistol.
Dr. Carpenter, in his ‘Elements of Physiology,’ mentions
that “in the neighbourhood of Basingstoke a paving-stone,
measuring twenty-one inches square, and weighing eighty-three
pounds, was completely raised an inch and a half out of
its bed by a mass of toadstools, of from six to seven inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
diameter, and that nearly the whole pavement of the town
suffered displacement from the same cause.” A friend has
seen a crop of puff-balls raise large flagstones considerably
above the plane of their original level; and I have myself
recently witnessed an extensive displacement of the pegs of a
wooden pavement which had been driven nine inches into the
ground, but were heaved up irregularly, in several places, by
small bouquets of Agarics, growing from below.</p>

<h2 id="heading6">REPRODUCTIVE POWER.</h2>

<p>Funguses have a remarkable power of re-forming such parts
of their substance as have been accidentally or otherwise removed.
Vittadini found that when the tubes of a <i>Boletus</i>
were cut out from a growing plant, they were after a time reproduced.
Where deep holes have been eaten into these plants
by snails, such holes, on the <i>Boletus</i> attaining to its full
growth, are partially refilled. If the tender <i>Polyporus</i> be cut
across, the wound immediately sets about healing by the first
intention, leaving not even a cicatrice to mark the original
seat of the injury. The <i>Lycoperdons</i> (<i>Bovista</i>), which are often
accidentally wounded by the scythe, have the same faculty of
repairing the injury, remodelling afresh the parts that may
have been excised from them.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<h2 id="heading7">MOTION.</h2>

<p>In a recent work on ‘Insect Life,’ I have discoursed somewhat
at large on the insufficiency of any kind of movements
as proofs of sensation, quoting, amidst other evidences to this
effect, certain remarkable movements in plants. Some of the
present family exhibit the phenomena of insensitive motion
in a remarkable manner, and might have been added to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
list already cited in that publication. Mr. Robson has given
us a very interesting account of the movements he observed
in the scarlet <i>Clathrus</i>, which is here transcribed in his own
words. It is interesting to notice how an unbiassed observer
uses the very terms to designate the movements of a plant
which would have been minutely descriptive of those of
an insect:—“At first I was much surprised to see a part of
the fibres, that had got through a rupture in the top of the
<i>Clathrus</i>, moving like the legs of a fly when laid on his back.
I then touched it with the point of a pin, and was still
more surprised when I saw it present the appearance of a
little bundle of worms entangled together, the fibres being
all alive. I next took the little bundle of fibres quite out,
and the animal motion was then so strong as to turn the head
halfway round, first one way and then another, and two or
three times it got out of the focus. Almost every fibre had a
different motion; some of them twined round one another, and
then untwined again, whilst others were bending, extending,
coiling, waving, etc. The fibres had many little balls adhering
to their sides, which I take to be the seeds, and I observed
many of them to be disengaged at every motion of the
fibres; the seeds appeared like gunpowder finely granulated.”
Instances from other authors abound. “An <i>Helvella inflata</i>,
on being touched by me once, threw up its seeds in the form of
a smoke, which arose with an elastic bound, glittering in the
sunshine like particles of silver.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> “The <i>Vibrissea truncorum</i>,
taken from water and exposed to the rays of the sun, though
at first smooth, is soon covered with white geniculated filaments,
which start from the <i>hymenium</i>, and have an oscillating
motion.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The <i>Pilobolus</i>, of which so accurate an account
has been given us by the great Florentine mycologist,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> casts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as its name imports, its seeds into the air; these also escape
with a strong projectile force from the upper surface of
Pezizas, the anfractuosities of the Morel, and from the gills
of Agarics.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h2 id="heading8">PHOSPHORESCENCE.</h2>

<p>Several kinds of funguses, and the spawn of the truffle, emit
a phosphorescent light; of the first, the <i>Agaricus olearius</i>, not
uncommon in Italy, is sometimes seen at night, feebly shining
amidst the darkness of the olive grove. The coal-mines
near Dresden have long been celebrated for the production
of funguses which emit a light similar to a pale moonlight.
Mr. Drummond describes an Australian fungus with similar
properties; and another very interesting one, an Agaric, is
noticed by Mr. Gardner, in his ‘Travels in Brazil.’<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h2 id="heading9">DIMENSIONS.</h2>

<p>Most funguses do not present great anomalies in their size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but retain nearly the same dimensions throughout the whole
course of their being; some few species, however, seem to
have a faculty of almost indefinite expansion. The usual size
of a puff-ball, as we all know, is not much larger than an egg,
but some puff-balls attain to the dimensions of the human
head,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> or exceed it. Mr. Berkeley quotes the case of a <i>Polyporus
squamosus</i>, which in three weeks grew to seven feet
five inches in periphery, and weighed thirty-four pounds;
also of a <i>Polyporus fraxineus</i>, which in a few years measured
forty-two inches across. Clusius<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> tells us of a fungus in
Pannonia, of such immense size, that after satisfying the
cravings of a large mycophilous household, enough of it
remained to fill a chariot; this must have been the <i>Polyporus
frondosus</i>, to which <i>Polyporus</i> John Bapt. Porta<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> also alludes
as that called <i>gallinace</i><a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> by the Neapolitans, which is so big,
he says, that you can scarcely make your hands meet round
it, “brachiis diductis vix homo complecti possit;” he had
known it attain twelve pounds weight in a few days.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Bolton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in 1787, found an <i>Agaricus muscarius</i>, which, “after the
removal of a considerable portion of its stalk, weighed nearly
two pounds;” Withering, an <i>A. Georgii</i>, “which weighed
fourteen pounds,” and Mr. Stackhouse another of the same
species in Cornwall, “which was eighteen inches across, and
had a stem as thick as a man’s wrist;” and I lately picked
in the park at Buckhurst, a <i>Boletus edulis</i> which measured
twenty-eight inches round its pileus, and eight round the
stem, and a few days later a <i>B. pachypus</i>, the girth of which
was thirty-two inches.</p>

<h2 id="heading10">CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.</h2>

<p>Of all vegetable productions these are the most highly
azotized, that is, animalized in their composition—a fact not
only evinced by the strong cadaverous smell which some of
them give out in decay, and by the savoury animalized meat
which others afford at table, but on the evidence of chemistry
also. Thus Dr. Marcet has proved that, like animals, they
absorb a large quantity of oxygen, and disengage in return,
from their surface, a large quantity of carbonic acid;
all however do not exhale carbonic acid, but, in lieu of it,
some give out hydrogen, and others azotic gas. They yield,
moreover, to chemical analysis the several components of
which animal structures are made up; many of them, in addition
to sugar, gum, resin, a peculiar acid called fungic acid,
and a variety of salts, furnish considerable quantities of
<i>albumen</i>, <i>adipocire</i>, and <i>osmazome</i>, which last is that principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that gives its peculiar flavour to meat gravy. The <i>Polyporus
sulphureus</i> is frequently covered with little crystals of the
binoxalate of potash;<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the <i>Agaricus piperatus</i> yields the
acetate of potash,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and it is probable that other funguses
of which we have as yet no recorded analysis will, on the
institution of such, be found to contain some new and unexpected
ingredient peculiar to themselves. When these several
substances have been duly extracted from funguses, there is
left behind for a common base the solid structure of the
plant itself; this, which is called <i>fungine</i>, is white, flabby,
insipid in its taste, but highly nutritious in its properties. If
nitric acid be poured upon it, an immediate disengagement
of azotic gas takes place, and several new substances are the
result: a bitter principle, a reddish resinoid matter, hydrocyanic
and oxalic acids, and two remarkable fatty substances,
whereof one resembles tallow, the other wax. If dilute sulphuric
acid be poured upon this fungine, no change ensues;
but if muriatic acid be substituted, the result is a jelly.</p>

<h2 id="heading11">USES.</h2>

<p>The uses to which funguses have been put are various, and,
had the properties of these plants been as extensively investigated
as those which belong to the phanerogamic classes,
they would probably by this time have proved still more
numerous: some, as the <i>Polyporus sulphureus</i>, furnish a useful
colour for dyeing;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the <i>Agaricus atramentarius</i> makes
ink; divers Lycoperdons, of which other mention will be
made presently when we come to speak of such species as are
esculent, have also been employed for stupefying bees, for
stanching blood, and for making tinder; their employment
in the first of these capacities, seems to have escaped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
observation of the accurate author of ‘Les Jardins,’ who has
mentioned the others:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Ce puissant Agaric, qui du sang épanché</div>

<p>The ‘caillou,’ alas, like the poet who struck this spark out
of it, is now obsolete; but <i>amadou</i> is still in vogue, being
employed for many household purposes; in addition to which,
a medical practitioner of Covent Garden has of late been in
the habit of using extensive sheets of it to cover over and
protect the backs of those bedridden invalids whose cruel
sufferings make such large demands upon our sympathy,—for
the alleviation of which so little is to be done!—as it is more
elastic than chamois leather, it is less liable to crumple up
when lain upon, and on this account has been preferred to it
by several of our metropolitan surgeons of eminence; some
employ it also as a gentle compress over varicose veins, where
it supports the distended vessels without pressing too tightly
upon the limb. Gleditsch relates, that the poorer inhabitants
of Franconia stitch it together, and make dresses of it; and
also that the Laplanders burn it in the neighbourhood of their
dwellings, to secure their reindeer from the attacks of gadflies,
which are repelled by the smoke; thus “good at need,”
it really deserves the epithet of ‘puissant,’ given to it by
Delille.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Polyporus squamosus</i> makes a razor-strop far superior
to any of those at present patented, and sold, with high-sounding
epithets, far beyond their deserts. To prepare the <i>Polyporus</i>
for this purpose, it must be cut from the ash-tree in
autumn, when its juices have been dried and its substance
has become consolidated; it is then to be flattened out for
twenty-four hours in a press, after which it should be carefully
rubbed with pumice, sliced longitudinally, and every slip
that is free from the erosions of insects be then glued upon a
wooden stretcher. Cesalpinus knew all this! and the barbers
in his time knew it too;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and it is not a little remarkable
that so useful an invention should, in an age of puffing, advertisement,
and improvement, like our own, have been entirely
lost sight of. Imperato employed and recommends it as an
excellent detergent, with which to brush and comb out the
scurf from the hair.</p>

<p>The <i>Agaricus muscarius</i> is largely employed in Kamtchatka,
in decoction with the <i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>, as an
intoxicating liquor.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The Laplanders smear it on the walls
and bedposts of their dwellings, to destroy bugs (Linn.); and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Clusius relates, that it is sold extensively in the market at
Frankfort, to poison flies; for this purpose, it is either cut into
small pieces and thrown about the premises, or else boiled
in milk and placed upon the window-sills; in either case it
is vastly inferior in efficacy to that celebrated “mort aux
mouches,” the impure oxide of cobalt, that is, to the arsenic
which this contains. The above are a few of the uses, exclusive
of the esculent or medical ones, to which funguses have
been put; it is fair, however, to notice that they maintain a
debtor, as well as a creditor, account with mankind, in which
the balance seems to be occasionally quite against us; those
that are most injurious are generally, as has been already
stated, of the microscopic kinds; whereof some attack young
plants still underground, emulging them completely of their
juices, in consequence of which they perish; others, like
the corn-blights, permit the plant to attain maturity before
they begin their work of destruction, and destroy it just as it
is beginning to fructify.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The fearful epidemics to which
grain so infected has given rise are well known, though it is
still a matter of question whether the ergoted corn owes its
unwholesome qualities to the injury which it had sustained
from the blight, or to the blight itself. Though the mischief
produced by parasitic funguses be unquestionably great, this
occasional and very partial evil is more than compensated by
the much greater amount of good accomplished solely by
their agency, in the assistance they afford to the decomposition
of animal and vegetable tissues, which has procured for them
the name, not unaptly applied, of “nature’s scavengers.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
This decomposition they effect by assimilating, through the
medium of their radicles, the juices of the decaying structure
in which they are developed, loosening thereby its cohesion,
and causing it to break up into a rapid dissolution of its
parts.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<h2 id="heading12">MEDICAL USES.</h2>

<p>Of the funguses formerly employed in medicine few are
now in vogue; the ergot of rye still keeps its ground, and in
cases of protracted labour, when judiciously employed, is
valuable in assisting nature when unequal to the necessary
efforts of parturition. Another fungus, formerly much in
fashion, though now put on the shelf, seems really to deserve
further trial; I mean the <i>Polyporus suaveolens</i> (Linn.), which
in that most intractable disease, tubercular consumption,
surely claims to be tried when there are such respectable
authorities to vouch for its surprising effects, in cases where
everything else had been notoriously unsuccessful.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Sartorius
was the first to prescribe it as a remedy in phthisis, and its
employment with this view, since his day, has at various
times been præconized on the Continent; the dose generally
recommended being a scruple of the powder two or three
times a day. Of the cases published by Professors Schmidel
and Wendst (which have an air of good faith in their recital,
well entitling them to consideration), I abridge one as an
example, though the others are not less interesting; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
while it is certainly to be regretted that the absence of stethoscopic
indications should prevent our having any positive evidence
as to the precise condition of the diseased lung, or of
the nature of the secretion expectorated, still, even supposing
them to be simple cases of chronic bronchitis, with marasmus
the efficacy of the remedy is scarcely less striking or instructive.
“A young man, ætat. twenty-one, was seized at the
beginning of autumn with inflammatory cough and hæmoptysis,
which were partially subdued by V. S. and the ordinary
antiphlogistic treatment; but the cough, coming on again
with renewed severity during the winter, was accompanied
with the expuition of glairy mucus, which was sometimes
specked with blood. Towards the spring the young man had
become much thinner, and was continuing to waste away; the
expectoration also had changed its colour, and had become
fetid and green; his nights were feverish and disturbed; he
had no desire for food, and ate but little; his ankles had
begun to swell; he had copious night-sweats and diarrhœa.
A teaspoonful of an electuary of the <i>P. suaveolens</i> in honey
was given him three times a day, and <i>nothing else</i>; and, extraordinary
as it may appear, under this treatment the sweats
speedily began to diminish with the cough, and after a three
months’ continuance of the medicine the patient entirely recovered.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Polyporus laricis</i>, the so-called Agaric of pharmacy,
is a powerful but most uncertain medicine, and has been also
recommended in consumption. I once administered a few
grains of it in this disease, when violent pains and hypercatharsis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
supervened, which lasted for several hours. MM. B.
Lagrange and Braconnot found it to contain a large quantity
of an acrid resin, to which it no doubt owes its hypercathartic
properties. To judge from this single case, which, however,
tallies with the experience of others, I should say that
this fungus was, in medicine, to be looked upon as a very
suspicious ally.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The <i>A. muscarius</i> has also been used in
medicine. Whistling, so long ago as 1778, wrote on its
healing virtues, in Latin, recommending its powder as a valuable
application with which to sprinkle sanious sores and
excoriated nipples. Plenck gave drachm doses of it internally
in epilepsy, and, together with Bernhard and Whistling, attests
its success. It appears that the <i>Phallus mucus</i> in China, and
the <i>Lycoperdon carcinomale</i> near the Cape of Good Hope, are
used also by the inhabitants of those countries as external
applications for cancerous sores. The <i>Phallus</i>, rubbed upon
the skin, is said to deaden its sensibility, like the <i>narke</i>, or
electric skate.</p>

<h2 id="heading13">FUNGUSES CONSIDERED AS AN ARTICLE OF DIET.</h2>

<p>If all the good things ever said about the stomach since the
days of Menenius Agrippa, or before his time, could be
collected, they would doubtless form an interesting volume;
Aretæus has somewhere quaintly, but not unaptly, called it
the “house of Plato;” in another place he speaks of it as the
“seat” (as if κατ’ ἐξοχὴν) “of pleasure and of pain;” and
so it is indeed, and it has moreover a notorious tendency,
when provoked, to cool our charity and to heat our blood; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sympathies by nervous attachments, both of “continuity”
and of “contiguity,”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> with the other organs of the body, are
extensive and complicated; no wonder then that it should
have enlisted ours in its behalf, and that few of us would
offend it wittingly, though by indiscretions we do offend it
continually.</p>

<p>In the “sensual philosophy,” of the French school particularly,
the stomach has received marked attention, ranking
in that country as the most noble of the <i>viscera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Even in
those republican times when no other rights were held sacred
throughout France, the privileges of the stomach were respected;
when men found that they might get on quite as
well, or better, with a bad heart, but that they could not get
on so well without a good digestion, it is not so much to be
wondered at if they made idols of their bellies, established a
School of Cooks to rival the School of Athens, and became
famous for “those charming little suppers in which they used
to set the decencies of life at defiance.”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> But if in France
far too much attention has been paid to the culinary art, too
little attention has surely been paid to it at home; for the
art of cookery, properly understood, is not only the art of
pleasing the palate, but the stomach also.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In France, the
dinner is the thought of the morning, and sometimes the
business of the day, but in France everybody dines; in England,
where the word ‘dinner’ never occurs till it is announced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a few wealthy men dine well, the middling ranks badly, and
the poor not at all. Not that even the poorer orders generally
want the necessary materials for such repast; they frequently
consume more butcher’s meat than is consumed by their Continental
neighbours; it is simply that they want skill in preparing
it. If it be scanty, they cannot tell how to make the
most of it; if it be homely, they cannot tell how to improve
its flavour by uniting and blending with it a certain class of
inexpensive luxuries, which, though they grow everywhere
throughout the country, are everywhere neglected. Touching
the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of these, I have now
a few words to address to the common-sense reader; that is,
to him who prefers feasting upon funguses to fasting out of
mere prejudice. Formerly men used to refer such questions
as this to their physician; they would</p>

<p class="noindent">intending, perhaps, to take some little poetical license with it
afterwards. Abernethy, on the anecdote of the oysters and
oyster-shells being duly substantiated, would have been <i>ostracized</i>
from polite society in those days of decorous etiquette,
when, as medical men affected to be more <i>dientereumatic</i> with
the insides of their patients than any of us now pretend to be,
they must needs have been far more affable when consulted on
such cases than we of the present day might be; though they
did not therefore always answer the same question in the same
way; one, for instance, “Le médecin Tant Pis,” would frequently
<i>proscribe</i> the very things that his rival, “Le médecin
Tant Mieux,” had just been recommending. When men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
came to find they must either give up some favourite article
of food or else give up the anathema pronounced against it,
they generally preferred the latter course, and were sure, to
use a medical phrase, to “do well” if they did so; whilst a
few wretched hypochondriacs, adopting the other alternative,
and living strictly <i>en régime</i>, became only the more hypochondriacal
for their pains.</p>

<p>None but a determined theorist<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> would nowadays think
of prescribing diet for the stomach of a single patient, far less
for all those of a polygastric public; neither does an enlightened,
self-educated public, that can read Liebig and
thoroughly appreciate its own case, hold out much encouragement
for such advice. The day is past without return for
long-winded prose epic on indigestion; a livelier mode of
dealing with the subject of <i>non-naturals</i>, in the shape of novels
and romances, has won the public ear. Broussais’ five-act
tragedy of ‘Gastro-Enteritis’<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> has received its last plaudits;
already has Crabbe’s <i>euthanasia</i> to this class of authors
attained its full accomplishment:—</p>

<p>No article of diet was ever half so roughly handled as the fungus.
What diatribes against it might be cited from the works
of Athenæus, Dioscorides, Galen, Pliny, the Arabian physicians,
and all their commentators! What terrible recitals,
too, of poisoning from some few species have been industriously
circulated, and the unfavourable inference drawn from
these, been applied to the whole tribe—a mistake which some
writers, even in modern times, have perpetuated. Thus,
Kirker votes the whole “a family of malignants;”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> thus too
Allen and Batarra pen unsolicited <i>apages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and warn us, in
an especial manner, to beware of them; while Scopoli includes
in his very definition of a fungus, that it is of a class of plants
which are always to be suspected, and which are for the most
part poisonous. Tertullian, with more of epigram than of
truth, makes out, that for every different hue they display
there is a pain to correspond to it, and just so many modes of
death as there are distinct species;<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> to all which, and a great
deal more similar rhapsody and invective, tens of thousands
of our Continental neighbours in the daily habit of eating
nothing else but funguses might reply, in the words of
Plautus—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Adeone me fuisse <i>fungum</i> ut qui illis crederem?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those who abuse funguses generally do so from prejudice
rather than from personal experience, objecting to their flesh
as being heavy of digestion, and to their juices as being more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
or less prejudicial to health. Some say they are too rich,
others of too heating a character. These objections are for the
most part without foundation, as those who eat them can
abundantly testify. To quote the authority of one or two
medical friends on the Continent, formed on large personal
experience, in favour of the excellence of this diet, Professors
Puccinelli of Lucca, Briganti of Naples, Sanguinetti of Rome,
Ottaviani of Urbino, Viviani of Genoa, are all consumers of
funguses. Vittadini, whose excellent work on the esculent
kinds of Italy is without a rival, himself eats, and gives us
ample receipts for dressing them. In France, a similar service
has been rendered to the public by Paulet, Persoon,
Cordier, and Roques,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> who have severally published excellent
treatises on the various kinds fit for food, as they occur in
the different provinces; whilst the influence of the last winter
has been the means of introducing several new species into
the Parisian markets, thus causing them to be very generally
known. Not to multiply individual testimony needlessly, let
that of Schwægrichen suffice, who tells us, that on seeing the
peasants about Nuremberg eating <i>raw</i> mushrooms,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> he too,
for several weeks, restricted himself entirely to this diet,
“eating with them nothing but bread, and drinking nothing
but water, when, instead of finding his health impaired, he
rather experienced an increase of strength.” <i>Vegetior evasit!</i>
as the inscription at Rome relates to have been the case with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
St. John when he emerged, after one hour’s cooking, from a
caldron of boiling oil. In a word, that which has been the
daily bread of nations—the poor man’s manna—for many
centuries, cannot be an unwholesome, much less a dangerous
food.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Funguses, no doubt, are a rich and dainty fare; and
so whatever objections apply to made-dishes <i>in genere</i> may
apply also to these, which, while they contain all the sapid
and nutritious constituents of animal food, have however an
advantage over it—viz. that while they are as rich in gravy
as any butcher’s meat, their texture is more tender, and their
specific gravity less. Touching the general question as to
the wholesomeness of made-dishes, it might perhaps be stated
as a rule, to which there are many exceptions, that the more
we vary and combine food, the better chance there is of our
digesting it.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> “You must assist nature,” Hippocrates says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“by art. You must vary your viands and your drinks.
Music would tire if it were always to the same tune, so also
does a monotonous regimen tire.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Cooks therefore make
<i>mixed</i> dishes, and he who should always make the same dish
would deservedly pass for not being a cook at all.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> And
though Sydenham, in apparent discordance with this, recommends
<i>one</i> dish for dinner, it is quite for another reason.
Plain food may indeed suit some stomachs, but good cooking
suits all stomachs; and when Seneca writes, that “there are
as many diseases as cooks,” Roques takes him up properly by
replying, “Yes; as bad cooks.” The rule for every dinner,
plain or compound, is to dress it well—“that which is best
administered is best;” and good cooking, thus understood as
the art of improving and of making the most of a thing, is a
matter of equal importance to both rich and poor. It is a
safe rule, I believe, and one recommended on good authority
too, if men wanted authority on such matter, to eat what they
like, but not as much of it as they like.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Nine-tenths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dyspeptics become so from overfeeding. “Nauseosa satietas
non ex crassis et pravis solum, sed etiam boni succi alimentis
provenit.” Even Paracelsus, though an undoubted quack,
might give some people a hint: “Dosis sola facit ut venenum
sit vel non; cibus enim vel potus qualibet quantitate majore
æquo assumtus venenum fit.” Dyspeptics are willing to enlist
your sympathies in their behalf by telling of the delicacy of
their mucous membrane, just as young countesses descant
with more success on the extreme susceptibility of their
nerves; nor is it always kindly received, if a well-wisher
should remind them that their sufferings may not after all
have been the fault either of their stomach or of the dish
which they blame, but of their own indiscreet use of both.
Whilst it is an acknowledged fact on all hands that infants are
overfed, and that all children overfeed, men are by no means
so prone or willing to admit that gluttony is perhaps the
very last of childish things that they are in the habit of
putting away from them. Thus, then, though funguses are
not to be considered unwholesome, they are, like other good
things, to be eaten with discretion and not <i>à discrétion</i>.
“If you live an indolent life, are a sybarite in your heart,
or should some violent passions (choler, jealousy, or revenge)
be dealing with you, take care in such a case how you eat
ragouts of truffles or of mushrooms; but if, on the contrary,
your health be good, your life temperately prudent, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
temper even, and your mind serene, then (provided you like
them) you may eat of these luxuries without the slightest
apprehension of their disagreeing with you.” M. Roques
adds, and with truth, “it is the wine, surcharged with alcohol,
of which men drink largely, in order, as they say, to relish and
digest their mushrooms and made-dishes, that disagrees with
the stomach, and that will, ere long, produce those visceral
obstructions, and those nephritic ailments, at once so grievous
to bear and so difficult to get rid of.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> If the reader shall
retain <i>one</i> word of the following homely lines, and that word
the last, so as to remember it in place, he will owe us no fee,

<p>But the objection against funguses is generally of another
kind: many persons who like good living too well to be afraid
of the new introduction of a luxury which is to bring new
dyspepsias for them in consequence, fear lest, whilst indulging
in this “celestial manna,” this βρῶμα θεῶν, they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
meet with the fate of the Emperor Claudius, and prefer remaining
<i>vivi</i> to the chance of becoming <i>divi</i> before their time.
Now there is really no just ground for this fear; the esculent
fungus never becomes poisonous, nor, conversely, the poisonous
variety fit to eat. In Claudius’s particular case we must
remember that Locusta medicated, and Agrippina cooked, that
celebrated dish, in which the mushrooms, after all, were but
the vehicle for the poison. As to the general fact, though
cultivation undoubtedly produces considerable changes in the
qualities of this, as in those of other classes of plants, they
are never of such a kind as to convert that which is esculent
in one locality into a dangerous food in another. “Cœlum non
animum mutat;” οὐ γὰρ τὸν τρόπον ἀλλὰ τὸν τόπον μόνον
μετήλλαξα.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> That the mushroom is not quite so wholesome
when cultivated as it is in the meadow,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in a state of nature,
cannot be doubted;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and that many persons have suffered,
both in France and England, more or less gastric disturbance
after eating those taken from hotbeds or from dark foul
unaerated places, is certain; that mushrooms also in decay,
when chemistry has laid hold of their tissues and changed
their juices, have produced disagreeable sensations in the
stomach and bowels, is not to be questioned; finally, that the
idiosyncrasy of some persons is opposed to this diet, as that
of others is to shell-fish, to melons, cucumbers, and the like,
must also be ceded: but none of these admissions surely
meddle with the question, nor go any way towards proving
the assumed fact, viz. that a mushroom ever changes its nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and becomes poisonous like the toadstool.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It has been
unwarily asserted, that because the people of the north are in
the habit of employing in their kitchen the <i>Agaricus muscarius</i>,
which is known to be poisonous in the south, this points
to some remarkable difference in the plant depending on difference
of locality. It is to be recollected, however, that this
very same fungus, if taken in sufficient quantity, without the
precaution usually adopted of soaking it in vinegar before
cooking, <i>has</i> produced fatal accidents, of which we read the recitals
in various mycological works; and only not more frequently
because the plant, being generally well steeped in brine
or acetic acid, is in most cases robbed of deleterious principles,
the only residue left being pure fungine, which is equally
innoxious and the same in all funguses whatever. It is
moreover worthy of remark, that though the common mushroom
(<i>Ag. campestris</i>) varies considerably both as to flavour
and wholesomeness (circumstances attributable in part to the
varieties of soil in which it flourishes<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>), other funguses, on
the contrary, being mostly restricted for their alimentation
and reproduction to some one particular habitat, do not
present such differences. The <i>Boletus edulis</i>, the <i>Fistulina
hepatica</i>, the <i>Agaricus oreades</i>, the <i>Ag. procerus</i>, the <i>Ag.
prunulus</i>, the <i>Ag. fusipes</i>, the <i>Cantharellus cibarius</i>, etc., are,
in flavour and other sensible qualities, just the same in England
as they are in France, Switzerland, or Italy. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
objection to eat funguses on the ground of their presenting
differences depending on those of the locality where they
grow, applies principally, if it applies at all, to the English
mushroom, of which no housekeeper is afraid, and by no
means to those species the introduction of which into our
markets and kitchens forms the main object of this treatise.</p>

<p>Besides the foregoing objections to funguses on the general
ground of their supposed indigestibility, or else the more particular
one of their not being at all times and in all places
the same, a further and weightier one, as it is commonly
urged, is the alleged impossibility of our being able to discriminate,
with certainty, the good from the bad; an objection
which derives much of its supposed weight from the apparently
clashing testimonies of authors respecting the same species,
who not unfrequently describe, under a <i>common</i> name, a fungus
which some of them assert to be esculent, some doubtful,
and others altogether poisonous in its qualities. Such discrepancies,
however, have already in many cases been satisfactorily
adjusted, whilst a more minute attention and corresponding
improvement in the pictorial representation of
species is daily diminishing the errors of the older mycologists.</p>

<p>Admitting then, what there is no gainsaying, the existence
of many dangerous individuals in this family,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> ought we not,
in a matter of such importance, rather to apply ourselves to
the task of discriminating them accurately<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> than permit idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rumours of its impracticability, or even its real difficulty, to
dehort us from the undertaking? Assuredly nature, who has
given to brutes an instinct, by which to select their aliment,
has not left man without a discriminative power to do the same
with equal certainty; nor does he use his privileges to their
full, or employ his senses as he might, when he suffers himself
to be surpassed by brute animals in their diagnosis of food.</p>

<h2 id="heading14">MODES OF DISTINGUISHING.</h2>

<p>The first thing to know about funguses is, that in the
<i>immense majority of cases</i> they are harmless; the innoxious
and esculent kinds are the <i>rule</i>, the poisonous the <i>exceptions</i>
to it; in a general way, it is more easy to say what we should
not eat than what we may; we should never eat any that
smell sickly or poisonous. Opinions respecting the agreeableness
or disagreeableness of an odour, as of a taste, may differ;
thus, in France and Italy (where the palate seems to us to
bribe the judgment of the nose), it is usual to speak of that of
the <i>Ag. prunulus</i> as “perfuming the air;”<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but though the
strong peculiar smell exhaled by this and some other esculent
funguses is anything but a perfume, as we apprehend the
term, it is very different from that intolerable fœtor, that
nauseous overwhelming odour given out by the <i>Phallus impudicus</i>,
the <i>Clathrus cancellatus</i>, the <i>Amanita verna</i>, and its
varieties. There are some indeed which, yielding no smell,
will poison notwithstanding; but then there are none to lure
us into a false security by a deceitful fragrance. The same negative
indications are furnished by the palate as by the nose;
those that are bitter, or styptic, or that burn the fauces on
mastication, or that parch the throat when they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
swallowed, should be put aside; those that yield spiced milk,
of whatever colour, should be held, notwithstanding exceptions,
in suspicion, as an unsafe dairy to deal with. The “Lucchese
Goat” (<i>Ag. piperatus</i>) and the “Cow of the Vosges” (<i>Ag.
lactifluus aureus</i>), though in high request in their respective
localities, and really delicate themselves, are akin to others
whose milks, though they may have the colour of gold, have
the qualities of gamboge.</p>

</div>

<p>Paulet was once so indiscreet as to eat a slice of the Griper
(<i>Ag. torminosus</i>), which belongs to this genus, and afterwards
still more indiscreet in giving it the inviting name of “Mouton
zoné;” it is well, however, that the reader should be apprised,
as he will frequently come across this ‘mouton’ in his walks,
that it is a perfect wolf in sheep’s clothing, nor less to be
avoided than one nearly allied to it, which rejoices in the
name of <i>necator</i>, or the slayer.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Here, as it is a safe rule
rather to condemn many that may be innocent than to admit
one that is at all suspicious to our confidence, we should, till
intimacy has made us familiar with the exceptions, avoid all
those the flesh of which is livid, or that, chameleon-like,
assume a variety of hues on being broken or bruised.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
external colour furnishes no certain information—with the
single exception of that of the gills in one or two Agarics—by
which to know the good from the bad; thus, the “Boule de
Neige” and the Vernal Amanite are both white; but the dress,
in one case, is of innocence, in the other of mere hypocrisy;
again, the green, which we are so cautioned to avoid in this
class of plants as chlorotic and unhealthy, and which is of
such bad augury in <i>Amanita viridis</i>, is quite the contrary in
the <i>Verdette</i> (<i>Ag. virescens</i>). So that to be led only by colour
would certainly be to be misled—a mistake which, in the family
of the <i>Russulæ</i>, might readily compromise life.</p>

<p>Some mycologists recommend, with certain exceptions, the
avoidance of such Agarics as have lateral stalks, of such as are
pectinate (<i>i. e.</i> have equal gills, like a comb), of such as have
little flesh in proportion to the depth of their gills, and
generally, of all those that are past their prime. Some warn
us not to eat after the snail, as we are in the habit of doing
in our gardens after the wasp; we may trust, it seems, to him
to point out the best greengages, but not to the slug to select
our mushrooms for us. Finally, it has been very currently
affirmed, though I think without sufficient warrant, that all
such funguses as run rapidly into deliquescence ought to be
avoided as dangerous. Here, while it might be unsafe to lay
down any positive rule beyond one’s own experience, this, so
far as it goes, would rather lead me to a different inference;
and even the reader will ask—Does not the mushroom deliquesce,
and is not ketchup, that “poignant liquor made from
boiled mushrooms mixed with salt,”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> to which we are all so
partial, this very deliquescence? But, besides this, the <i>Ag.
comatus</i>, which is highly deliquescent, is largely eaten about
Lucca; the <i>Ag. atramentarius</i> also is, on our own authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<i>periculo ventris nostri</i>, as good for ketchup as for that purpose
to which its juices are more commonly put, viz. for making
ink. Thus, amongst deliquescent Agarics, there are some the
juices of which are both safe and savoury, perhaps of more
than those here recorded; but as I have not hitherto myself
made trial of any others, and as there are some dangerous
species mixed up with this group, the public cannot be too
much cautioned against making any rash experiment, where
the consequences of a mistake might be so serious.</p>

<p>Some trees give origin by preference to good, others to
deleterious species; thus, the hazel-nut, the black and perhaps
the white poplar, together with the fig-tree, grow only
good sorts; whereas the olive has been famous, since the days
of Nicander, for none but poisonous species.</p>

<p>The elm, the alder, the larch, the beech, and some other trees,
seem capable of supporting both good and bad species at their
roots; hence it is not safe to trust implicitly to the <i>tree</i> to determine
the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of the fungus that
grows out of it, or in its neighbourhood. The presence of a <i>free
acid</i> is by no means conclusive either way, there being many
species of both good and bad, which will indifferently turn
litmus-paper red. The old and very general practice adopted
by cooks of <i>dressing funguses with a silver spoon</i> (which is
supposed to become tarnished, then, only when their juices are
of a deleterious quality), is an error which cannot be too generally
known and exposed, as many lives, especially on the Continent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have been, and still are, sacrificed to it annually. In some
cases the kitchen-fire will extract the deleterious property from
the funguses, which it would have been unsafe to eat raw, and
frequently the acrid lactescent kinds change their nature entirely
and become mild by cooking; in other cases, the virus is
drawn out by saturating the fungus, sometimes before dressing
it, either in vinegar or brine,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the liquid then containing the
poison which was originally in the plant; but in other species,
as in <i>Ag. emeticus</i>, it would seem from the experiments of M.
Krapf, of Vienna, upon living animals, that it is to be extracted
neither by ebullition nor desiccation.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The effects produced by the poison of mushrooms are exceedingly
various, that is to say, the virus itself differs in
different species, both as to <i>kind</i> and, where that is the same,
as to the <i>degree</i> of its concentration; it is generally, however,
of the class called acro-narcotic, producing inflammatory affections
of the intestines, and exerting a deleterious influence
over the whole nervous system. In cases where only a very
small quantity has been taken experimentally, a constriction
of the fauces has followed, and continued for a period varying
from some minutes to several hours, occasioning, or not,
nausea, heat, and, in some instances, even pain of the stomach;
“sometimes the affection is entirely confined to the head, and
a stupor or light delirium succeeds the eating of some species,
and continues for two or three days.”<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Not unfrequently, as
in those cases cited by Larber, the symptoms have been altogether
those of cholera, without any cerebral disturbance whatever;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
but in other instances that have come to my knowledge,
during a several years’ residence on the Continent, these have
been of a mixed character,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in which both the head and
viscera have participated; and the autopsies after death have,
in accordance with the symptoms, shown the stomach and
intestines more or less disorganized with the products of inflammation,
together with a congested state of the brain or of
its investments, or a local or general softening of its substance.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The poison, as has been said, exists in very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
degrees of intensity in different species. In some, as the
<i>Amanita verna</i>, a few grains of the fresh fungus suffice to kill a
dog;<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> while the <i>Agaricus muscarius</i>, though equally fatal in
sufficient quantities, is not nearly so strong. Some time in general
elapses from the swallowing the poison to that in which
its deleterious workings first begin to be felt. I have heard of
cases (similar to those cited in the last note) of persons who
had supped overnight on the meal that was to prove their last,
who have slept, risen next morning, gone to work, and continued
working for hours, before they have been made aware
of their condition. When, however, the symptoms have once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
set in, they become rapidly more and more alarming, while
the chances of arresting or mitigating their excruciating severity
lessen every minute. As the evils to be apprehended
from the agency of these plants can only be prevented by their
instant evacuation, to assist the disposition to vomit, or, if
called in early enough, to anticipate it by the milder emetics
in sufficient doses (surely not by strong ones, as some have
recommended!), and, when the stomach has been thoroughly
evacuated, to relieve the violence of the pain by bland mucilaginous
drinks, with opiates, are the indications plainly
pointed out, and the means by which inflammation and subsequent
sphacelus of the gut, as well as the deleterious effects
produced on the nervous system by the absorption of the
poison into it, have been occasionally averted; but should
symptoms of great depression be already present (as too frequently
happens before the medical man arrives), he will
endeavour, in that case, to rally the vital powers (scanty
though the chances of success will then be) by small and repeated
doses of sulphuric ether and ammonia combined, or
should head symptoms require his interference, he must in that
case bleed.</p>

<h2 id="heading15">CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO THEIR GROWTH.</h2>

<p>Of these, in fact, we know but little, and in the great majority
of instances absolutely nothing; in a few cases moisture<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
and heat seem alone sufficient, even in our own hands, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cause some of them to grow; in others, electricity appears
indispensable. A wet autumn is generally found to be exceedingly
prolific in these plants, with the following notable
difference as to <i>kind</i>: all those that are parasitical on trees
show themselves, during a wet season, in amount directly
varying with that of the previous rain, irrespective of any
other influences conspiring to give this effect; whilst those,
on the other hand, which issue from the earth, when the
surface of this has been long chilled or when the electrical
state of the air has not been materially modified for some
time, will be found to come up sparingly or not at all, whatever
rain may have fallen. An exception to this rule occurs
in the common mushroom, which, by the combination of
certain degrees of heat and moisture, may be reared throughout
the year without the co-operation of electricity. A
variety of plans have been recommended for this purpose,
many of which are both troublesome and expensive; the
following, taken by M. Roques from a scientific work on
gardening, and said to be infallible, has, if so, the great
advantage of extreme simplicity to recommend it:—“Having
observed that all those dunghills which abounded chiefly in
sheep- or cow-droppings, began shortly to turn mouldy on
their surface and to bear mushrooms, I collected a quantity
of this manure, which, so soon as it began to turn white, I
strewed lightly over some melon-beds and some spring crops
of vegetables, and obtained in either case, and as often as I
repeated the experiment, a ready supply of excellent mushrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which came up from a month to six weeks after the
dung had been so disposed of; but as an equable temperature
is in all cases desirable to render the result certain, where
this cannot be secured under the protection of glass, the next
best plan is to scatter a portion of the above dungs mixed
with a little earth in a cave or cellar, to which some tan is
an excellent addition; for tan, though it kills other vegetable
growths, has quite an opposite effect on funguses.”</p>

<p>Next to the common mushroom, in regard to the success
attending its cultivation, comes that of the <i>Pietra funghaia</i>,
a plant unknown to Clusius, but described by Mathiolus and
Imperato, under the name of the ‘stony fungus.’ Cesalpinus
has added to their accounts, directions for procuring it
the whole year through, which, he says, is to be done either
by irrigating the soil over the site of the stone, or by transferring
the <i>Pietra funghaia</i> with a portion of the original
mould, and watering it in our own garden. Porta adds, that
the funguses take seven days to come to perfection, and may
be gathered from the naked block (where this has been properly
moistened) six times a year; but in preference to merely
watering the blocks, he recommends that a light covering of
garden mould should be first thrown over them. The <i>Pietra
funghaia</i>, though its range of territory be extremely small,
lies embedded in a variety of soils, in consequence of which
its Polyporus, like our own mushroom, is very various in
flavour, depending on the kind of <i>humus</i> in which its matrix
happens to be placed. Those that grow on the high grounds
above Sorrento, and on the sides of Vesuvius, are in less
esteem than such as are brought into the Naples market from
the mountains of Apulia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>A third fungus, which we have the means of producing <i>ad
libitum</i>, is that which sprouts from the pollard head of the
black poplar;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> these heads it is usual to remove at the latter
end of autumn, as soon as the vintage is over, and their
marriage with the vine is annulled; hundreds of such heads
are then cut and transported to different parts; they are
abundantly watered during the first month, and in a short
time produce that truly delicious fungus, <i>Agaricus caudicinus</i>,
the <i>Pioppini</i>, which, during the autumn of the year, make
the greatest show in many of the Italian market-places.
These pollard blocks continue to bear, for from twelve to
fourteen years; I saw a row of them in the botanic garden
at Naples, which, after this period, were still productive,
though less frequently, and of fewer Agarics at a crop. The
practice of rearing funguses from the poplar is not modern;
Dioscorides knew, for he tells us that if we “bark the white
or black poplar, cutting the bark into pieces and covering it
with horse-dung, an excellent kind of fungus will spring up,
and continue to bear throughout the year:” by way of comment
to which passage Mathiolus adds, that a little leaven<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
will produce an abundant crop in four days. Another fungus,
which I have myself reared (<i>Polyporus avellanus</i>), is to be
procured by singeing over a handful of straw a block of the
cob-nut tree, which is then to be watered and put by. In
about a month the funguses make their appearance, which
are quite white, of from two to three inches in diameter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
excellent to eat; while their profusion is sometimes so great,
as entirely to hide the wood from which they spring.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Dr.
Thore says, that in the Landes, the <i>Boletus edulis</i> and <i>Ag.
procerus</i> are constantly raised by the inhabitants of that
district, from a watery infusion of the said plants; that something
more than this, however, is necessary, seems certain,
since during the two or three years during which I frequented
the baths of Lucca, and was in the habit of using infusions of
these and a variety of other funguses, often throwing them
over the very spots where each kind grew, my experiments
never succeeded. Nor was Dr. Puccinelli, of Lucca, who
repeated similar experiments in the botanic garden there,
much more successful. Briganti, of Naples, told me much
the same story; and Sanguinetti at Rome was equally unsuccessful
with Ottaviani at Urbino. On making inquiry of
friends in England who have attempted to propagate different
kinds of funguses, either by infusion or otherwise, their attempts
generally failed. My friend Mrs. Hussey, in particular,
acquaints me that she has been in the habit of subjecting
many plants to a like experiment, and with similar
want of result. Lastly, as concerning truffles, Mr. Bornholtz
has given directions how to rear them, which, as they
are exceedingly expensive and troublesome, must needs be
infallible to secure proselytes, even among the most sworn
amateurs of these delicacies. “Prepare your ground,” says
he, “with oak leaves in decay; you must also mix some iron
with it and take care to make it of a proper consistence, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
by adding sand, should it be too compact, or clay, should it be
of too light a nature; having then with great care transplanted
your truffles, (which must be properly packed with a quantity
of the original mould about them,) they are to be placed
tenderly in the new settlement, covered over lightly with mould,
and this again is to be covered with boughs of oak and <i>Carpinus
Betulus</i> to protect the deposit from molestation; neither
must you consider your work completed till a sacred grove of
these particular trees has been planted round it, which must be
done with such precaution, that while they keep the precious
ground in a perpetual twilight, they must not obstruct it too
much, but leave a certain free passage to the air.” After
which injunctions, if they be carefully attended to, Mr. B.
assures us that we can reckon, without fear of disappointment,
on a dish of truffles, whenever we may want them for ourselves
or our friends.</p>

<h2 id="heading16">FAIRY RINGS.</h2>

<p>We know as little of the origin of fairy-rings, as of any
other phenomenon connected with the growth of funguses.
These fairy-rings are of all sizes, from one and a half to
thirty feet in diameter; the grass composing them is observed
in spring, to be of a thicker growth than the surrounding
herbage, and, in consequence of the manure afforded by the
crop of last year, is of a darker colour. Within these rings
are frequently seen certain varieties of this class of plants,
very generally Agarics, though puff-balls frequently, and
occasionally the <i>Boletus subtomentosus</i>, affect a similar mode
of growth. Of the Agarics which appear in these circles,
some of the principal are <i>Agaricus oreades</i>, <i>Ag. prunulus</i>, <i>Ag.
Orcella</i>, <i>Ag. Georgii</i>, <i>Ag. personatus</i>, and <i>Ag. campestris</i>.
As all these feed at the expense of the grass, (by exhausting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the ground that would otherwise have furnished it with the
necessary supplies,) the richest vegetation in the field is
generally the first to become seared. These rings (giving
birth to some one species which, dying, is not unfrequently
succeeded by another a little later, and this perhaps by a
third, in the same order of occurrence) continue to enlarge
their boundaries for a long but indefinite period.</p>

<p>It seems not easy to determine precisely, to the operation
of what cause or causes the increase in the size of these circles
from year to year should be attributed. Is it the projectile
force with which the spores are disseminated all round, that
has carried them so uniformly beyond the margin of the last
ring as to form a concentric circle for the next of larger
diameter beyond? Or is the cause to be sought underground,
in the general spread of the spawn of last year in all directions
outwards, but only fertile in a concentric ring <i>beyond</i> the
site of the last crop, which had already exhausted the ground,
and so rendered it incapable of supporting any new vegetable
life? Or do both these causes conspire in this result? The
quantity of spawn and of the spores necessarily contained in
it, and the depth to which they penetrate under the surface of
the soil, renders the possibility of their spreading in the latter
way easily conceivable.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

hypothesis as this, ceases to be the opposite and antagonist
principle to death, of which it then becomes but a different
mode and a new phasis. It is not the incomprehensibility of
such a notion (be it well understood) against which the objection
lies, for as life begins and ends in mystery, that would
be no objection; it lies in the rashness of attempting to solve
an admitted mystery, by placing a palpable absurdity in its
room; vainly and irreverently arrogating to itself the honours
of a discovery which we are to believe if we can! At this
rate, addled eggs, abandoned by the vital principle, might
take to hatching themselves! A more legitimate and very interesting
subject for inquiry is, whether those funguses which
are parasitical (<i>i. e.</i> derive their support from the structures
whence they emanate) are so many separate constituents of a
superior life <i>under analysis</i>, or each of itself a new individual?
In support of the first view, it is urged that since reproduction
in such lower existences is nothing but a modification of nutrition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a new process might well originate from its perversion,
and thus give rise to new products; and just as the change in
the ordinary nutrition of our bodily organs is prone to give birth
to various local disorganizations or morbid growths, such, it is
argued, might be the origin of fungoid growth on trees. But
then comes the difficulty: such a view does not, and plainly cannot,
explain the development of the <i>not</i> parasitical kinds, of
which the origin should be the same; no, nor even of all that live
by suction at the expense of other plants, since there are as
many kinds which quicken in <i>dead</i> and decaying structures,
as there are that issue out of decrepit and <i>living</i> ones; here,
then, it is plain that perverted nutrition can have nothing to
do with their production, for in this case nutrition has, by the
supposition, ceased; and to talk of disease <i>after</i> death would
be a strange figure of speech indeed! An elm or oak is frequently
dead five, seldom less than three, years before these
parasitical growths make their appearance, from which it
would appear to follow that seeds are not developed by, but
that they must be extraneous to, and independent of, any
pathological relation of the plant from which they grow. If
then fungus life be not to be sought for, and cannot with
propriety be said to originate in any morbid conditions of the
tissues from which they spring, whence do they derive life—in
other words, whence in every instance comes that particular
seed which, when quickened, is to produce after its
kind? Lies this dormant for a season in those dead and
decaying tissues, which a little later the plant originating
from it is destined to embellish; or is the living germ first
brought to them by the winds, and merely deposited on their
surface, as in a fitting <i>nidus</i> on which their future development
is to be effected? Some writers take one view, some
another. Many believe the seeds of funguses to come directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from the earth,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and to be drawn up with the sap, which, as
it penetrates throughout the tissues of the plant, must carry
the seeds also along with it. That such is actually sometimes
the case is certain, since we can not only plant parasitical
blights of a particular kind so as to infect particular plants,
but may also by digging a trench between those that have
already become diseased, and those that are still healthy, stay
the progress of the blight—thus clearly establishing not only
the fact of seeds, but also the highly interesting additional
one, of their ascent into the structures of plants by intus-susception;
and to arrive at a general view from these particular
cases, this would seem to be the usual mode of their
propagation. Neither does it make against this view nor is it
more in favour of the other, which supposes the germs to be
derived primarily from the air, and to be thence precipitated
on the structures where they grow, that funguses are found
on organizations in decay, on withered boughs, and on seared
leaves, out of which all sap must of course have been long
ago exsiccated; for what then? though the sap does, the seeds
do not, evaporate with it. These, once absorbed and diffused
during the lifetime of the plant throughout its whole economy,
remain there in a state of potential activity, ready to burst
forth and germinate whenever the necessary conditions for
these wonderful changes shall be presented to them, just as
though the seeds of corn now flourishing in different parts of
England, had first existed for some thousand years as mummy
wheat, potentially and unquickened. Nothing perishes in
nature: “destructio unius matrix alterius;” life may change
titles, but never becomes extinct; so soon as the more perfect
plant dies, a host of other vegetable existences, hitherto enthralled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
by laws of an organization superior to their own,
now that the connection has been dissevered, put forth their
separate energies, and severally assert their independence. The
poplar may have perished, root, stem, and branch, but its
extinction is only the signal for other existences, which had
been heretofore bound up and hid within its own, to assert
themselves; and accordingly a Polyporus sprouts out here;
here a Thelephora embellishes the dead bark; and here an
Agaric springs out of the decaying fibres of its head: these in
turn also decay, but as they <i>moulder</i> away they languish into
a new kind of fungous life, of an inferior type to the last, as if
their own vitality were inferior in kind to that of the decayed
poplar, whence they lately issued.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Thus, since the seeds of
funguses actually exist in great quantity in other plants, and
since they occur in the closed interior of fruits and in corollas
which are still in their envelopes (in either case out of the
reach of the external air); since finally, the <i>Pietra funghaia</i>,
which produces a Polyporus unknown to England, may be,
notwithstanding, made to germinate in England by furnishing
the stone with adequate supplies of water and of heat, <i>that</i>
seems the more tenable hypothesis of the two, which, in every
case, supposes the <i>nidus</i> of the fungus to furnish the seed, and
the atmosphere, the conditions necessary for its quickening.
How the seed is first made to quicken is another and most
interesting question, still evolved in mystery. As there is no
ocular evidence to be obtained of the usual organs of sex,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
some mycologists have separated funguses from the family of
the clandestinely married <i>Cryptogamia</i>, to place them with the
<i>Agamia</i>, which repudiate the marriage tie;<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> but as every argument
from ignorance is unsafe, (and such would appear to be
particularly the case here, when we consider how many things
undoubtedly exist, which the imperfection of lenses and the
circumscribed power of the eye prevent our seeing,) we should
rather make use of what is displayed to us in the economy of
other plants, in the way of analogy as applied to these, than
deny what is likely, merely because it is not an object of sense.
It would appear then, from what has been stated, that certain
funguses are produced like other plants, from seeds; and
more likely at least, in the parasitic kinds, that such seeds are
derived by the plant which supports them from the ground,
than deposited from the atmosphere. Before we proceed to
the description of species, a few more words remain to be said
about these spores, and a brief notice to be taken of those
parts that are essential to all, and more especially of such as
are characteristic of those higher forms of funguses which are
the more immediate subject of the present work.</p>

<h2 id="heading18">SPORES OR SEEDS.</h2>

<p>All funguses have not seeds,—at least, seeds apparent to us;<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
but if we reflect that these, even where visible, can do no more
than present to our senses the visible tabernacle of that life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which is still invisible, and which, not being material, must
ever elude our search,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> then it will not appear so difficult to
conceive that the apparently seedless threads of some particular
moulds should include, in their interior, vital germs of
some sort, which, being homogeneous with, or of the same
colour as, the parenchyma of the mould itself, are invisible—just
as we know them to be for a season in puff-balls, in the
veins of truffles, or in the <i>Agyrium</i>, the receptacle of which
last breaks up, when ripe, into sporidia, which then and not
till then become manifest. The seeds of funguses are called
spores: in the great majority of cases, the microscope, which
brings their shapes under observation (for to the naked eye
they appear as dust), presents them to us as round, oval, oblong,
or even angular corpuscules, and, more rarely still,
echinulate or with a tail. They are as various in size as in
shape, the first bearing no proportion whatever to the dimensions
of the future plant. They vary, too, greatly in colour,
being sometimes of a pure white, and continuing so throughout
the whole of their seminal existence; at other times, the
white acquires a yellow tinge on drying. Some are brown,
some yellow, some pink, some purple, some purple-black, and
some pass successively from pink to purple, and from purple
to purple-black.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> These seeds or spores are sometimes naked,
but are much more commonly shut up in little pouches or
receptacles, either of a regular or of an irregular shape; the
first are called <i>thecæ</i>, the latter <i>sporanges</i>; thecæ (which are
in shape similar to the cases of the same name that used to
receive the ancient εἱλίγματα, or scrolls) are small, cylindrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
bodies, in which the seeds lie <i>one over the other, as in a rouleau</i>;
they are themselves let into a <i>receptacle</i> (or that part of
the fungus the office of which is to receive and support the
reproductive organs) in a regular and symmetrical manner, and
at length occupy it completely. Not all are prolific; for some,
pressing upon others, cause them to abort, leaving wherever
this happens, sterile thecæ, or <i>paraphyses</i>, between those that
are fertile. <i>Sporanges</i> are little globose or turbinated receptacles,
frequently furnished with a pedicle, in which the seeds
lie without order, as they are themselves inserted symmetrically,
or without order, into the receptacle. Sometimes these
seeds are packed in series of fours, as in the fimetary Agarics; in
other genera, as in the Helvellæ and Morels, they are stored
away in series of eights. The spores, so soon as they are ripe,
either drop out of the sporiferous membrane (<i>hymenium</i>),
or, as more frequently happens, are projected from it with
an elastic jerk, or else, as is the case of Agarics of a deliquescent
kind, return to the earth mixed up with the black
liquid into which these ultimately resolve themselves. Sometimes
the <i>whole</i> external surface of the fungus is dusted with
seed; but much more frequently they are restricted to some
particular part, and either lie on the upper side, as in the
<i>Pezizæ</i>, or on that which is beneath, as in the mushroom.
The spores generally lie on the outside of the fungus, but in
the puff-ball, as every one knows, they are internal, and in
such prodigious quantity as sometimes entirely to fill its
cavity. It is a speculation from Germany, that spores are
capable of altering their forms, and that according to the accidents
of climate or soil, they assume this or that type, and
give rise at different times to different kinds of funguses; on
which it is sufficient to remark, that while there is not the
least foundation for such an hypothesis, there is in fact much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
evidence against it; nature acts by immutable laws and has
no changelings. To appeal to experience, when did mushrooms
ever spawn toadstools? When was the <i>Pietra funghaia</i>
ever seen to bring forth anything but its own Polyporus? or
the fig, the poplar, or the hazel (when singed and watered
to render them prolific) exhibit any but their own particular
mushroom? Spores are endowed, like other seeds, with an
extraordinary vitality, which may lie dormant in them for an
indefinite period; but unlike most other seeds, they seem capable
of resisting the prolonged heat of boiling water, infused
in which, and poured upon the ground, they are still capable
of producing each after its kind. The specific gravity of spores
is greater than that of water, as may be seen by placing a
mushroom over a glass which contains it, when, falling upon
the surface, they presently subside to the bottom. These
spores sometimes merely multiply without any further progress
in development; sometimes they proceed a certain way only,
and then, the conditions necessary for their further advance
failing, this is arrested; sometimes, as in the <i>Sistotrema</i>, the
plant <i>appears twice</i> under a <i>perfect</i> form, being for part of its
existence a <i>Hydnum</i>, and during the other half a <i>Boletus</i>;
but, generally speaking, these minute corpuscular bodies are
destined to receive an infinite variety of protean and imperfect
forms, and to pass stage by stage, and step by step, to the full
attainment of that ultimate one which they assume when their
growth has reached its natural limits. Sometimes the spore
expands outright into a puff-ball; sometimes it shoots up
straight into a club, as in some of the Clavarias; or lies like
a bowl, resupinate on the ground and stalkless, as in the
<i>Peziza</i>; in other cases, it assumes the more perfect but much
less simple forms of <i>Chanterelle</i>, <i>Boletus</i>, <i>Dædalea</i>, <i>Morel</i>, or
<i>Mushroom</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF SEEDS.</h3>

<p>The mode in which the organs immediately containing the
seeds are formed, differs according to the family. In the tribe
of puff-balls, where the seed is formed in the interior of the
fungus, there is no hymenium; a few of the internal cells
(when the Lycoperdon has attained its full size) begin to enlarge,
and these in a short time are found to contain small
granules, generally of a determinate number, and moistened
by a fluid secreted from within the walls. In such funguses
as have an hymenium it is only some of the superficial cells,
and these in a particular position in reference to the receptacle,
that contain seeds; though perfect identity of structure
throughout, is evinced in a conclusive manner if we invert the
head of a young fungus on its stalk; for then these thecæ
begin to form and to fill themselves with seed, not on the side
where they were about to do so previous to this inversion of
the head, but on that which was the uppermost and sterile
surface, and which, now that it is the undermost, has become
prolific. The expansion of a fungus, according to Vittadini, is
effected as follows:—“These thecæ,” of which we have been
speaking, “as they swell, become distended with the contained
seed, and mostly so at their free extremity, since they have
more room for expansion in that direction than at the other,
which is impacted into the substance of the pileus; in consequence
of this, a series of wedges are formed which, as the
seed continues to distend them, force out the pileus, loosen
its marginal connections with the stalk, uncurl its involuted
borders, and finally open up its cells, pores, and sinuses.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>In those subterranean funguses which mature their seeds
below the surface of the ground, the lower portion, so soon as
this is accomplished in the upper, suddenly takes to grow upwards,
carrying along with it the bag, which, on reaching the
surface of the ground, bursts its envelopes and scatters its prolific
dust to the winds. All funguses, as has already been observed,
have in all probability spores, though in a few instances,
of byssoid growths, (Hyphas, Himantias, and Æthelias,) these
are not apparent; in most cases too, they are attached to an
hymenium, into which, or on the surface of which, they are
placed till ripe. One very large tribe, by far the largest, are
called <i>Hymenomycetes</i>, from ὑμήν, a membrane, and μύκος, a
fungus; <i>i. e.</i> funguses with a seed membrane: to distinguish
them from those other kinds, very small numerically in proportion
to themselves, <i>Gasteromycetes</i>, in which the seeds, arranged
and stored away in particular receptacles, named sporanges
or thecæ, are with them included in the belly (γαστήρ)
of the fungus, as is the case in truffles and puff-balls. The
hymenium, like that curiously doubled-down sheet of paper
which conjurors turn into so many shapes, assumes a great
variety of forms; running down the gills of the mushrooms
and the plaits of the <i>Cantharellus</i>, up into the tubes of the
Boletuses; sheathing the vegetable teeth of <i>Hydna</i>, forming
an intricate labyrinth of anastomosing plates in <i>Dædalea</i>; now
rising into little rough eminences on the surface of the <i>Thelephoræ</i>,
and now affording a smooth investment to that of the
<i>Clavariæ</i>. It is covered with a veil, which disappears so soon
as the spores begin to ripen, and its protection is no longer
required; seen under the microscope, it appears to be wholly
made up of thecæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUCCESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPORES.</h3>

<p>When the spore is to cease to be a spore, and to become
a mushroom, the first thing it does is to send forth certain
cotton-like filaments, whose interfacings entangle it completely
while they also serve to attach it to the place of its
birth; these threads (like the spongioles attached to the roots
of phænogamous plants, whose name sufficiently explains their
office) absorb and bring nourishment to the quickened spore,
which then maintains itself entirely by intus-susception. All
this takes place before the germ has burst, or the embryo fungus
begun to develope its organs. In some instances, these
elementary threads are, like the ordinary roots of plants,
spread out to a considerable distance underground, forming
here and there in their course small bulbs or tubercles, each
of which, in turn, becomes a new individual; in others, and
more commonly, these spores are sprinkled about unconnectedly,
as in the <i>Pietra funghaia</i>, affecting certain spots
only, which become so many small matrices whereof each furnishes
a crop. The union of many germinating granules together
with their connecting threads, constitutes mushroom
spawn, or, as it is technically called, <i>carcytes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Examined a
short time after quickening, the spore is found to have swelled
out into a fleshy kernel; which in puff-balls, truffles, and the
uterine subterranean families generally, constitutes of itself
the whole fungus; this only grows in size afterwards, the
substance and original form remaining the same through the
entire period of development. In those destined to live under
the influence of air and light, this same rudimental nucleus
gradually evolves <i>new parts</i>, and assumes, as we have seen, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
vast variety of forms, (whereof each particular one is predetermined
by the original bias imprinted upon every spore at
its creation,) and here there is a manifest analogy with the
progressive development of new parts in the higher plants. In
such funguses as are wrapped up in a volva or bag, during the
earliest period of growth, this furnishes them not only with
the means of protection, but of nourishment also. This volva,
which is formed by the mere swelling out of the original
fleshy bulb, when it has grown to a certain size, exhibits towards
its centre the rudiments of the young fungus; of which
the receptacle appears first, and all the other parts in succession.
The embryo, next taking to grow, in its turn approaches
the circumference of the volva, which, having by this time
ceased to expand, is burst open, and sometimes with much
violence, by the emerging Amanite. As soon as the hymenium
has parted with its seed, which falls from it in the form of fine
dust, the fungus, collapsing, either withers on its stem, or else
dissolves into a black liquid and so escapes to the earth. In such
funguses as have not a volva, the basilar or primary nucleus
shoots up at once in the form of a cone, and a little later presents
at its apex the rudiments of a receptacle or head; by
degrees, and frequently by slow degrees,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> the perfected structures
of the plant are elaborated and spread themselves out
into some of the forms mentioned above, of which the clavate
is the most simple, and that with gills the most complex. The
primary nucleus is formed out of simple cellular membrane,
the cells of which, at first elongating, and at length uniting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
into little bundles, assume a fibrous appearance; sometimes
these fascicular bodies effuse themselves unchanged into the
substance of the receptacle, in which they spread out and
are lost; at others, a transverse line makes the demarcation
between the pileus and stem.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The last part formed in a
fungus, generally, is that which bears the seed; and whenever
an exception to this occurs, and the seed is formed at an
earlier period than usual, nature has in this case provided
three membranes, to cover and protect these delicate organs
till the plant shall have attained maturity: these are the ring
(<i>annulus</i>), the veil (<i>velum</i>), and the wrapper (<i>volva</i>).</p>

<h2 id="heading19">OF THE ANNULUS, THE VELUM, AND THE VOLVA.</h2>

<p>Of these involucra the first two are partial, the other universal.
The Volva is a thick membranaceous covering, originating
at the base of the fungus, which it thus connects
with the earth, and furnishes, during its fœtal life, with the
means of support and nourishment. When this has ceased,
and the plant has quitted its wrapper, if this still adhere to
the base of the stalk, it is styled manifest (<i>manifesta</i>), but if
there be no traces of it left, obliterated (<i>obliterata</i>). It is
<i>free</i> when it can be easily detached, and <i>congenital</i> when it
cannot without laceration. In funguses with bulbous roots
it is congenital, in those without bulbs it is free. All funguses
that have a volva are of course <i>volvati</i>, but as this organ
exists in many only so long as they are underground, mycologists
are agreed to restrict the term to such alone as retain
it afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Ring.</i>—This, which differs considerably in form, substance,
and in its attachments, is composed either of a continuous
sheet of membrane or else of a number of delicately-spun
threads, resembling a spider’s web,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> which in either case
passing from the margin of the pileus to the corresponding
upper portion of the stem, give way as the plant expands, and
either festoon for a season the margin of the cap, or encircle
the stalk with a ring. The marginal remains of the Annulus
are extremely fugacious, but the ring round the stalk, though
generally transitory, is sometimes persistent; it is <i>superior</i>
or <i>descending</i> when originating from the summit of the stem,
it descends outwards and downwards to form connections with
the rim of the pileus; <i>inferior</i> or <i>ascending</i> when, coming
off from that portion of the stalk which is below the pileus,
it ascends to attach itself to this. In a few cases the ring
is partly membranaceous and partly composed of radiating
arachnoid threads.</p>

<p><i>The Veil.</i>—Some funguses not only present the ring just
mentioned, their hymenium or seed membrane being further
protected from harm by a second investment, the veil, <i>Velum</i>,
the stalk origin of which, when existing in conjunction with
an annulus, is below it, but when the fungus is not annulate,
the velum rises higher up on the stalk, stretches across to
meet and is afterwards reflected over the whole surface of the
pileus; on the expansion of the Agaric this investment is entirely
broken up, and exhibits those well-known flocks, which
have been called by the learned <i>verrucæ</i>, but which, as they
are generally of a dirty leprous hue, and affect more or less
of a circular arrangement, have procured for this whole tribe
of Amanites in Italy the uncomely epithet of <i>tignosi</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
scald-heads. Where there has been both a volva and a velum,
as sometimes happens in the same fungus, these verrucæ are
of different colours according as they are remnants of the
first merely, or of both together.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The velum in the subgenus
<i>Limacium</i> is a slimy coating adhering to the head of
the fungus, which then looks as if it had been dipped in gum
mucilage; this generally disappears after a time, leaving the
epidermis dry, though sometimes, like the solid membranaceous
veil, it is more or less persistent. The waxy covering
on the pileus of the <i>Ag. virescens</i>, which after a time cracks
and tessellates its surface, is only an exudation limited to the
upper portion of the cap, and not a veil.</p>

<p id="heading20"><i>The Stalk.</i>—This, which is absent in many parasitical funguses
of the Order <i>Pileati</i>, when present, either effuses itself
uninterruptedly into the substance of the pileus, which it
then, in fact, <i>forms</i>, or else supports merely as on a pillar, a
distinct line of demarcation showing where the fibres terminate.
It assumes a great variety of forms, which serve in
many instances to characterize species; besides which peculiarities
there are others to be noted, as the mode of its insertion
into the pileus, its having or not having a ring, the circumstance
of its being scabrous, glossy, or tomentose, reticulated,
spotted, or striped, of one colour above and another
below, or of its changing colour when bruised, any of which
may sometimes assist our diagnosis.</p>

<p><i>The Pileus.</i>—By far the larger number of funguses mentioned
in this work have a pileus, or cap; all such belong to
the first great tribe <i>Pileati</i>; they include the genera <i>Agaricus</i>,
<i>Boletus</i>, <i>Cantharellus</i>, <i>Morchella</i>, <i>Hydnum</i>, <i>Fistulina</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<i>Polyporus</i>, each of which furnishes its quota of alimentary
species, together with many others not esculent. The form
of the pileus, like that of the stalk, is various in these different
genera, besides being variable in the different species of
the same genus; generally it assumes an orbicular or umbrella
shape, especially in such funguses as grow solitary on the
ground, whilst in others, parasitical on trees, (particularly when
they have no stalk,) it is more or less of a half-hemisphere.</p>

<p id="heading21"><i>The Gills.</i>—Those vertical plates on the under surface of
the mushroom, which radiate from the centre to the circumference,
like the spokes of a wheel, are called Gills (<i>lamellæ</i>);
they are not formed, as some have supposed, of layers of the
reduplicated seed-membrane alone, but by a prolongation of
the fibres of the pileus, which these merely invest. The fibrous
structure is most apparent in Agarics with thick gills;
in those where the flesh changes colour when bruised; or
where, the interposed flesh remaining white, the hymenium is
tinged with the colour of the ripening spores. In those funguses
which have little flesh the upper surface of the pileus,
especially towards the circumference, is frequently furrowed
with transverse sulci; these are occasioned by the sinking in
of the epidermis along with the fibres of the flesh between
the layers of the hymenium, and consequently their position
always corresponds precisely to that occupied by the backs of
the gills. The end nearest the stalk is termed posterior
(<i>postica</i>), the opposite extremity anterior (<i>antica</i>); the terminations
of the lesser gills take place at various distances
short of the stalk, which the perfect gills reach, and down
which they sometimes course or are decurrent (<i>decurrentes</i>);
they are said to be adnate (<i>adnatæ</i>) when connected at their
posterior end; free (<i>liberæ</i>) when they do not adhere; remote
(<i>remotæ</i>) when they terminate at a certain distance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
stem; emarginate (<i>emarginatæ</i>) when they are obtusely notched
or hollowed out posteriorly; denticulate (<i>denticulatæ</i>) when
connected by means of a tooth; equal (<i>æquales</i>) when all of
the same length; forked (<i>furcatæ</i>) and branched (<i>ramosæ</i>)
when they divide in their course, once, or more frequently, or
are connected at the sides with the imperfect gills; dedalean
(<i>dædaleæ</i>) when they anastomose irregularly together; simple
(<i>simplices</i>) when they are free from all connections; distant
(<i>distantes</i>) when they are few and wide apart; close (<i>confertæ</i>)
when they are very numerous and touch each other; serrated
(<i>serratæ</i>) when notched like a saw; waved (<i>undulatæ</i>) when
the margin is undulating; and imbricating (<i>imbricatæ</i>) when
they lie one over another, like tiles.</p>

<p><i>The Tubes.</i>—Funguses of the genus <i>Boletus</i>, etc., present
on their under surface, in place of gills, series of small hollow
cylinders or tubes; which are for the most part soldered side
to side like the cells of a honeycomb, but in the <i>Fistulina</i>
are unconnected. Like the gills, they are prolongations of the
fibres of the pileus, but lined, instead of coated, by the hymenium;
their free extremities are the pores, which at first are
closed, but afterwards open to let the seed escape: they are
generally of equal length and simple, but sometimes in the
interior of a large one smaller tubes may be discerned, in
which case the first is termed compound. With reference to
the stalk, they are either adnate or decurrent, they first appear
as a network formed by slight prominences of the fibres of the
pileus; if at this early period a portion be removed together
with a piece of the flesh, it is reproduced in a few days and
the tubes developed as usual. The beautiful reticulations
observed on the stalk of some Boletuses are produced by
abortive tubes decurrent along their surface.</p>

<p><i>The Plaits</i>: Venæ, Plicæ.—The plaits of the Chanterelle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
are formed like the gills and tubes of the mushroom and
Boletus, <i>i. e.</i> by the fibres of the flesh running down from
the pileus, and invested in a reduplication of the hymenium;
with this difference, however, that while in the two latter the
seed membrane is divided into as many portions as there are
gills or tubes, in the former the continuity of its surface is
perfectly unbroken. These plaits (<i>plicæ</i>) are always late in
appearing, and sometimes are only developed when the fungus
is about to cast its seed.</p>

<p><i>The Spines</i>: Aculei, etc.—The under surface of the pileus
in the genus <i>Hydnum</i> is shagged with vegetable spines or
teeth (<i>dentes</i>, <i>aculei</i>) of unequal lengths, generally isolated,
but sometimes connected at the base, and formed originally
out of a congeries of minute papillæ invested by the hymenium,
which gradually elongate their fibres and assume this
form. Light seems essential to their production, for if a
Hydnum grow in the dark, the teeth shrink up into long
threads and are sterile.</p>

<h2 id="heading22">METHODICAL DISTRIBUTION
OF THE
BRITISH ESCULENT FUNGUSES.</h2>

<p>The primary division of Funguses into <i>Hymenomycetes</i> and
<i>Gasteromycetes</i> is founded upon the position of their seed,
which lies, as we have seen, externally in the first, and internally
in the members of the second. The funguses described
in the present work belong chiefly to the first division, <i>Hymenomycetes</i>;
to Tribe 1, <i>Pileati</i>; and many of them to Genus
1, <i>Agaricus</i>. This genus includes a great variety of species,
and is distinguished from all other genera by having a fleshy
pileus furnished underneath with <i>gills</i>, which are placed at
right angles to the stem. Some species, during their infancy,
are enclosed either in one or more membranes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Division I.</span> HYMENOMYCETES.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tribe 1.</span> <i>PILEATI.</i></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Genus 1.</span> AGARICUS.</h5>

<p>Old words in Natural History seldom become obsolete, but
they change their meanings strangely. Were Dioscorides and
Pliny <i>redivivi</i>, they would find nothing but misnomers! The
term <i>Agaricus</i>, which anciently applied indiscriminately to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hard coriaceous funguses growing on trees (while the word
<i>Fungus</i> did imperfect duty for this genus), was next arbitrarily
made by Linnæus to stand representative for such only as
had gills, “fungi lamellati terrestres et <i>arborei</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Persoon,
again, under the name <i>Amanita</i> (a Galenic word, but hitherto
unappropriated), made a new genus of such Agarics as were
invaginated, <i>i. e.</i> shut up during the earlier period of their
development in a volva; of such as had veins in place of gills,
<i>Merulius</i>; and of such as had anastomosing gills formed another,
<i>Dædalea</i>, a third division. More recently, Fries has
greatly simplified the study of this very large and difficult
genus by eliminating all of a coriaceous texture, and (having
restored to it the genus <i>Amanita</i>) by then dividing the whole
into sections; enabling us to arrive at an accuracy in the discrimination
of species which was wholly unattainable before
his time. His first grand series of Agarics comprehends those
of white spores (<span class="smcap">Leucospori</span><a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>), and of this his first section is—</p>

<h6>Subgenus 1. <span class="smcap">Amanita.</span><a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></h6>

<p>All the Agarics belonging to this subgenus are, during the
immaturity of the fungus, furnished with a volva and a ring;
some have a velum in addition, and in this case, the surface
of the pileus is covered with warts, or verrucæ. This natural
division was adopted long ago by Micheli, who gave the name
<i>Uovoli</i> to those which had only the first two, and that of
<i>Tignosi</i> to those that had all three. Altogether they form
but a very small group, but one very important to distinguish
accurately, as it includes, besides one or two very delicate
species, some which are highly poisonous.</p>

ground; <i>pileus</i> thick, convex, irregular in shape, more or less
tuberculated, sometimes lobed;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> margin not striate, wavy, expanding
unequally; <i>epidermis</i> cream-coloured, grey, reddish,
or of a dirty nankeen hue, paler towards the circumference,
soft to the touch like kid, minutely tomentose, fragile, dry,
firmly attached to the flesh; flesh firm, compact; <i>gills</i> watery,
white, very numerous, irregular, with many smaller ones
(from 5-11, <i>Vitt.</i>) interposed, lying over each other like the
plaits of a frill, adnato-emarginate,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> the imperfect gills
rounded off at their posterior end. <i>Stem</i> white, robust, firm,
solid, somewhat irregular in form, generally thickened at the
base, constantly so in young specimens, but in older ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
though occasionally bulging, it presents not unfrequently an
equal cylinder throughout, and sometimes tapers slightly
downwards. The fibres are effused into the pileus, spreading
out like a fan through its substance; <i>smell</i> strong, <i>taste</i> agreeable;
<i>spores</i> white, elliptical, adhering firmly to the body on
which they fall. The dried plant retains much the same form
it had when fresh.</p>

<p>On tracing this fungus to its origin, (spring is the only
time, and the borders of the woodlands the proper place, to
look for it,) if we dig up the earth where it grows, this will
be found mouldy to a considerable depth beneath the surface,
and strongly impregnated with the peculiar odour which the
<i>Prunulus</i> exhales; this apparent mouldiness being, in fact, the
spawn, amidst the white filaments of which many minute
Agarics, in various stages of their development, may be found;
some, in the earliest, presenting merely white cones destitute
of heads, whilst in others a slight protuberance indicates the
future pileus forming or already formed. The pileus is at
first almost spherical, and involute in its borders, the gills
whitish, very minute, and so thickly set as to press one
against the other, each communicating to the membrane that
lines the next the impressions of its own fibres, which remain
in the form of transverse striæ, and furnish a characteristic
to this fungus retained during all its subsequent growth (<i>Vitt.</i>).
The greatest size which I have known the <i>Prunulus</i> attain has
been in England, where I have picked specimens measuring
six inches across, and weighing between four and five ounces;
as to the fecundity of this fungus, I collected this spring,
from a single ring on the War-Mount at Keston (Kent), from
ten to twelve pounds, and in the one field from twenty to
twenty-five pounds. In this neighbourhood they are generally
destroyed, as injurious to his grass-crops, by the over-careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
farmer, quite ignorant, of course, of their value; to which the
following extract from a letter of Professor Balbi to Persoon
bears testimony:—“This rare and most delicious Agaric, the
<i>Mouceron</i> of Bulliard, and the <i>Ag. prunulus</i> of other authors,
abounds on the hills above the valley of Stafora, near Bobbio,
where it is called Spinaroli, and is in great request; the country
people eat it fresh in a variety of ways, or they dry and
sell it for from twelve to sixteen francs a pound.” Vittadini
says, truly enough, that the fresh is better than the dried
<i>Prunulus</i>, the substance of the latter being rather coriaceous,
but the gravy prepared from it in this state, being very rich
and well-flavoured, is largely used by those who reject the
body of the mushroom; three or four thrown into a pot of
the lighter broths or of beef-tea render them more savoury.
To dry the <i>Prunulus</i> it is usual to cut it into four or more
pieces, which are exposed for some days to a dry air and then
threaded: it acquires an aroma by the process, and communicates
this to any dish of which it is afterwards an ingredient.</p>

<p>It would be extremely difficult to confound this Agaric
with any other; its mode of growth in circles, the extreme
narrowness of its gills, which are moreover striate, the thickness
of its pileus, and the bulging character of its stalk,
would render a mistake almost impossible, even did it grow
in autumn when other funguses abound, in place of appearing
only in spring when few species comparatively abound.</p>

<p>The best mode of cooking the <i>Ag. prunulus</i> is either in a
mince or fricassee it with any sort of meat, or in a <i>vol-au-vent</i>,
the flavour of which it greatly improves; or simply prepared
with salt, pepper, and a small piece of bacon, lard, or butter,
to prevent burning, it constitutes of itself a most excellent
dish. It has the great advantage of appearing in spring, at a
season the common mushroom never occurs. I have placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it first in the series of Plates, as being the most savoury
fungus with which I am acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>When eaten alone, Sterbeck’s white mustard will be found
an excellent condiment for it; this is prepared as follows:—Bruise
in a mortar some sweet almonds with a little water,
then add salt, pepper, and some lemon-juice, rub together till
the whole is of the consistence of common mustard.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate2"><span class="smcap">Plate II.</span></a></p>

<p class="center">Subgenus <span class="smcap">Lepiota</span>, <i>Fries</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“Elle est d’une saveur très-agréable et d’une chair tendre, très-délicate
et très-bonne à manger. Les amateurs la préfèrent même
au champignon de couche, comme ayant une chair plus fine et étant
beaucoup plus légère sur l’estomac.”—<i>Paulet.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This, which is one of the most delicate funguses, fortunately
is not rare in England. In Italy it is in equal request
with the <i>Amanita Cæsarea</i>; in France it is also in high esteem,—“servie
sur toutes les tables, elle est bonne à toute
sauce” (<i>Thore</i>); and were its excellent qualities better known
here, they could not fail to secure it a general reception into
our best kitchens, and a frequent place among our side-dishes
at table. The beauty and remarkable appearance of this
Agaric have procured for it a variety of names: <i>colubrinus</i>,
from the snake-like markings on the stem; <i>clypeatus</i>, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
its umbonated top; ‘<i>fungo parasole</i>,’ from the orbicular form
of the wide-spread pileus; and <i>Gambaltiem</i> or <i>Fonz de la
gamba lunga</i>, from the extraordinary height of the stalk.
Autumn is the time of its greatest abundance, but individual
specimens occur occasionally throughout the summer.</p>

<p>It grows solitary or few together in hedgebanks and pasture-grounds.</p>

<p>The pileus, which is commonly from four to four and a half
inches across, sometimes attains a width of six or seven. At
first it is concealed in a volva, but breaking from this it goes
through a variety of forms, from that of an ovoid cone to that
of a flattened disk. It is umbonated at the centre, and covered
with scales, which are formed by the breaking up of the
mud-coloured epidermis, and are large, raised, and persistent
at the centre; thin, regular, and lighter in hue at the circumference,
“the whole surface resembling a delightfully soft,
shaggy-brown leather” (<i>Purton</i>). The flesh of the pileus is
white and cottony, that of the stalk fibrous and somewhat
brittle, with a subrubescent tinge, the whole plant turning to
a rufous-orange when bruised; the gills are of a pale flesh-colour,
occasionally forked, ventricose, denticulate, remote
from the stalk, and having a circular pit between it and their
central extremities, which are fixed into a kind of collar.
The stalk tawny, striped circularly with bands of white,
formed by the breaking up of the epidermis; is bulbous at
the base and attenuated upwards; its apex rounded, and penetrating
deeply through the flesh of the pileus (which receives
it as in a socket), gives rise to the central umbo on the
upper surface of the cap. The ring moveable, like that of an
umbrella-stick, broad, compact, membranaceous immediately
round the stalk, and fibrous towards its free margin, is white
above and tawny or of the same colour as the stalk on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
under surface. The smell is like that of newly-ground meal;
the taste is pleasant; the spores are white and elliptic.</p>

<p>The <i>Ag. excoriatus</i> resembles the <i>Ag. procerus</i> very closely,
but is easily distinguished from it by its smaller size, the absence
of the bulb at the base of the stalk, and the ring being
often attached instead of free.</p>

<p>Being equally esculent, the following receipts will serve for
both:—</p>

<p>“Comme il est très-léger et très-délicat, il faut le faire
sauter dans l’huile fine après l’avoir assaisonné d’un point
d’ail, de poivro et de sel; en quelques instants il est cuit. On
le mange aussi en fricassée de poulet, cuit sur le gril ou dans
la tourtière avec de beurre, de fines herbes, du poivre, du sel,
et de la chapelure de pain; on ne mange point la tige, elle est
d’une texture coriace” (<i>Roques</i>).</p>

<p>The ketchup from both kinds is better than that procured
from the <i>Agaricus campestris</i>, or common mushroom.</p>

<p class="smaller">N.B.—I have in the above notice described one variety of <i>Agaricus procerus</i>;
there is, however, if not another, at least a remarkable modification of this, in
which the pileus is thinner and much less shaggy, the gills less broad but similar
in shape, the stalk more slender and elongate. This variety is also nearly void
of odour, <i>and its flesh does not change colour on being bruised</i>: for culinary
purposes this distinction is without importance, as both are equally good.</p>

<p>The ancient Romans were well acquainted with this truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
delicious fungus, and in general appear to have done it justice;
the strings of dried Suillus, which his countrymen, on
the testimony of Pliny, were in the habit of fetching from
Bithynia, were in all likelihood the same as those similarly-prepared
strings of the modern Porcino which are sold during
the winter in every market-place throughout Italy.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
Vittadini mentions a curious fact respecting them, viz. that
though they are composed of many different Boletuses, no
mischief was ever known to originate from their indiscriminate
and very extensive consumption; whence he concludes
that <i>all</i> the species of this genus are innocuous, or, at least,
that drying and cooking will extract any deleterious principles
which they may have originally contained;—an inference, he
thinks, supported by the daily use among the peasantry of
certain districts of the <i>B. luridus</i>, which of all bad Boletuses
commonly passes for the worst, and by his having experimented
with it in large doses upon animals, who did not suffer
in consequence. I have eaten in England a small quantity
both of <i>B. Grevillei</i> and of <i>B. granulatus</i>, which have much
of the flavour of the <i>B. edulis</i>; of the <i>B. subtomentosus</i>(though,
on the authority of Trattinick, it is eaten in Germany) I have
no personal experience, nor do I recommend to the amateur
any species beyond the two universally eaten and approved of
on the Continent, viz.:—<i>B. edulis</i> and <i>B. scaber</i>.</p>

<p><i>B. edulis.</i>—<span class="smcap">Bot. Char.</span> <i>Pileus</i> from six to seven inches
across, pulvinate, smooth, with a thick margin, varying in
colour from light brown or bronze, to bay, dark brown, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
black, or a mixture of all these colours. The epidermis firmly
adherent to the flesh, that firm, and except the part in immediate
contact with the skin, which has a slight brown tint,
white; the under surface of the cap nearly flat, often presenting
a circular pit or depression round the stalk; <i>tubes</i> at
first white, then yellow, lastly of an olive or yellow-green tint,
in the earlier stage of development (their free extremities then
lie against the side of the stalk) closed; afterwards, as the cap
expands, stopped up with a waxy-looking material of a dirty
pearl colour. <i>Stem</i> varying much in shape at different periods
of the growth of the <i>Boletus</i>, always thick and solid; at first
white, but soon changing to fawn colour, beautifully meshed
or mapped (especially on its upper portion) with reticulations
characteristic of this species. As the period for casting its
seed advances, the inferior surface of the cap swells out, the
waxy matter is absorbed, the tubes present deep and rounded
orifices to the eye, and presently emit an abundant seminal
dust, of an ochraceous green hue (sometimes difficult to collect,
from the quantity of moisture exhaled with it), after which
both cap and stalk become flaccid, the tubes turn to a dirty
green, and the whole fungus falls rapidly into a state of
decomposition. The favourite sites for this <i>Boletus</i> are woods,
especially those of pines, oaks, and chestnuts; it abounds in
autumn, but occurs in spring and occasionally in summer.
There is one variety, the <i>pinicola</i>, whose name gives its whereabouts,
which differs from the foregoing, in having a moist,
somewhat sticky cap, a watery flesh changing near the tubes
to a light yellow-green when bruised; the reticulations are
ill-marked in this species.</p>

<p>The <i>Boletus edulis</i> cannot be mistaken for any other <i>Boletus</i>
because it alone presents all the following characters united,
viz. a cap of which the surface is smooth; tubes the colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of which varies with each period of its growth, beautiful and
singular reticulations of the stalk, especially towards the
upper portion, and a flesh which is white and unchanging.</p>

<p>The <i>Boletus castaneus</i>, which bears, some little general resemblance
to it, is at once distinguished by having a cottony
fibrillose stem without reticulations, a downy cap and dirty
yellow dust: neither can it be confounded with the <i>B. subtomentosus</i>
nor <i>B. luridus</i>, because in addition to many other
points of difference, both these change colour on being cut or
bruised.</p>

<p>As to the best manner of cooking <i>B. edulis</i>, this must be left
to the taste of the gourmet; in every way it is good. Its
tender and juicy flesh, its delicate and sapid flavour, render it
equally acceptable to the plain and to the accomplished cook.
It imparts a relish alike to the homely hash and the dainty
ragout, and may be truly said to improve every dish of which
it is a constituent. “Nihil tetigit quod non ornavit.”
“Though much neglected in this country, it appears to be
a most valuable article of food. It resembles much in taste
the common mushroom, and is quite as delicate; it abounds
in seasons when these are not to be found.” (<i>Berkeley.</i>)</p>

<h4><i>Modes of Cooking Boletus edulis.</i> (<span class="smcap">Persoon.</span>)</h4>

<p>It may be cooked in white sauce, with or without chicken,
in fricassee broiled or baked with butter, salad oil, pepper,
salt, chopped herbs, and bread-crumbs; to which some add
ham or a mince of anchovy. It makes excellent fritters:
some roast it with onions (basting with butter), but as these
take longer to cook than the <i>Boletus</i>, this must not be put
down till the onions have begun to soften.</p>

<h4><i>Boletus edulis Soup, made in Hungary.</i> (<span class="smcap">Paulet.</span>)</h4>

<p>Having dried some <i>Boletuses</i> in an oven, soak them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tepid water, thickening with toasted bread, till the whole be of
the consistence of a <i>purée</i>, then rub through a sieve, throw in
some stewed <i>Boletuses</i>, boil together, and serve with the usual
condiments.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any one in England who does not feel
himself competent to decide on the genuineness of a mushroom:
its pink gills are carefully separated from those of a
kindred fungus <i>Ag. Georgii</i>, which are of a flesh-coloured grey,
and out of the pickings of ten thousand hands, a mistake is
of rare occurrence; and yet no fungus presents itself under
such a variety of forms, of such singular diversities of aspect!
the inference is plain; less discrimination than that employed
to distinguish this, would enable any who should take the
trouble, to recognize at a glance many of those esculent
species, which every spring and autumn fill our plantations
and pastures with plenteousness. Neither is this left to be a
mere matter of inference; it is corroborated in a singular manner
by what takes place at Rome; here, whilst many hundred
baskets of what we call toadstools are carried home for the
table, almost the only one condemned to be thrown into the
Tiber, by the inspector of the fungus market is our own
mushroom:<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> indeed, in such dread is this held in the Papal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
States, that no one knowingly would touch it. “It is reckoned
one of their fiercest imprecations,” writes Professor Sanguinetti,
“amongst our lower orders, infamous for the horrible
nature of their oaths, to pray that any one may die of a
<i>Pratiolo</i>;” and although it has been some years registered
among the esculent funguses of Milan and Pavia (on the
authority of Vittadini), it has not yet found its way into those
markets. Besides the general botanical characters which
apply to all varieties of <i>Ag. campestris</i>, almost every writer
has felt the necessity of pointing out several peculiarities,
belonging to each. Common to all are a fleshy pileus, which
is sometimes smooth, sometimes scaly, in colour white, or of
different shades of tawny, fuliginous, or brown; gills free, at
first pallid, then flesh-coloured, then pink, next purple, at
length tawny-black; the stem white, full, firm, varying in
shape, furnished with a white persistent ring; the spores
brown-black, and a volva which is very fugacious.</p>

<h4><i>Var.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A</span>. <i>edulis</i>.</h4>

<p>This, which is our button mushroom, lies at first concealed
in the earth, at which period it presents the appearance of a
puff-ball; at a second stage of its growth, it exhibits a white,
smooth, and continuous epidermis; gills rounded off at their
posterior end; a large, somewhat funnel-shaped, <i>double</i> ring,
free, and somewhat moveable on the stem, which is short and
thick. This, according to Vittadini, is the most sapid variety
of any.</p>

<h4><i>Var.</i> <span class="smcapuc">B</span>. <i>pratensis</i>.</h4>

<p>This differs from the last in the duskier hue of its pileus,
which is moreover scaly, and has ragged margins; the gills
are ventricose; and the ring, which is subfugacious, is cortinarious,
<i>i. e.</i> of a cobweb texture, and reflexed; the stalk is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
longer than in the last species, and tapers towards the base;
the colour of the flesh in this variety is vinous or even
sanguine.</p>

<h4><i>Var.</i> <span class="smcapuc">C.</span> <i>silvicola</i>.</h4>

<p>This differs from the two former in the following particulars;
the gills are <i>pallid</i>, taper <i>equally</i> at both ends, and come
off at a considerable distance from the stalk, which is surrounded
above by a very delicate ring, and is <i>bulbous</i> at the
base, the bulb showing traces of the volva.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<h4><i>Var.</i> <span class="smcapuc">D</span>. <i>anceps</i>.</h4>

<p>Such <i>uncultivated</i> mushrooms as when eaten even in small
quantity, produce violent derangement of the stomach and
intestinal canal, belong to a variety which, since it grows under
hedges, is sometimes called “the hedge mushroom;” this,
to which, for distinction’s sake, I have given the name of <i>anceps</i>,
is by no means of rare occurrence. In order to discriminate
it properly from the wholesome varieties, the first point to
notice is its extreme lightness as compared with its bulk, that
the gills are of a deeper and of a more lurid red than those of
<i>var. edulis</i>, and in age less purple; they are also less deliquescent.
The flesh is more tough and not so juicy. The stem,
as in the <i>var. silvicola</i>, is curved and bulbous, but also fistulose
throughout. The ring complete, firm, broad, reflexed,
and <i>persistent</i>; the odour disagreeable, and the taste insipid.
The form of the pileus that of an obtuse cone in young specimens;
extremely flat in the middle state; and more or less
concave in age. It seldom grows solitary. The mushroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
proper, like other funguses, should be eaten fresh; a few hours
making all the difference between its wholesomeness or unwholesomeness:
nor need this surprise us when we consider how
many principles enter into its composition, how short is the
period of its existence, and how liable it must be to enter into
new combinations in consequence. Vauquelin found in its flesh
fat, adipocere, osmazome, an animal matter insoluble in alcohol,
sugar, fungine, and acetate of potash. What a medley! and what
wonder, if the changes induced during decomposition should
cause the indigestions suffered by those who have eaten them
in this state! The mushroom, having the same proximate
principles as meat, requires, like meat, to be cooked before
these become changed. The <i>Ag. campestris</i> may be prepared
in a great variety of ways: they give a fine flavour to soups,
and greatly improve beef-tea;—where arrow-root and weak
broths are distasteful to the patient, the simple seasoning of a
little ketchup will frequently form an agreeable change. Some
roast them, basting with melted butter and white (French)
wine sauce.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In patties and <i>vols-au-vent</i> they are equally
excellent; in fricassees, as everybody knows, they are the
important element of the dish. Roques recommends in all
cases the removal of the gills before dressing, which though
it secures a more elegant-looking <i>entremet</i>, is only flattering
the eye at the expense of the palate.</p>

<h4><i>Var.</i> <span class="smcapuc">E</span>. <i>bovinus</i>.</h4>

<p>This variety differs from the <i>Ag. Georgii</i> and the type of
the species in size and other particulars. There are specimens
which measure fifteen inches across the pileus, with a stalk of
corresponding dimensions. The pileus is shaggy, like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the <i>Ag. procerus</i>, with epidermic scales, which are at first
nearly white, but in fully developed specimens, of a rich
tawny colour, like the <i>Polyporus squamosus</i>; and sometimes
of a red-brown. The scales more depressed than in <i>Ag. procerus</i>,
the gills not ventricose, equal at both ends, separated
from the stalk by a fossa or groove which runs round its apex;
the stalk solid, attenuated at the very base, but thickened just
above it, a slightly vinous hue when bruised; flesh of ring
perfect, persistent, and hanging round the stalk like a sheet
of thin white kid; into which a number of delicate silver
threads may be traced proceeding from the apex of stem.
The smell is powerful but agreeable, as also is the flavour; no
part of the surface ever turns yellow. This variety is both
wholesome and well-flavoured; as it is commonly known by
the peasants under the name of the “Ox-Mushroom,” I have
called it <i>bovinus</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Receipt I.—“A la Provençale.</i>”</h4>

<p>Steep for two hours in oil, with some salt, pepper, and a
little garlic: then toss up in a small stewpan over a brisk
fire, with parsley chopped and a little lemon-juice.</p>

<h4><i>Receipt II.—To stuff Mushrooms.</i></h4>

<p>Take large mushrooms, full-grown, but not black; remove
the gills, and place in lieu of them the following stuffing:—bacon
shredded, crumbs of bread, chopped herbs, and a little
garlic or eschalots (as for omelettes), salt, pepper, and a taste
of spice. Broil in paper as a Maintenon cutlet, moistening
with butter when necessary.</p>

<h4><i>Receipt III.—Mushrooms “à la Marquis Cussi.</i>”</h4>

<p>Take button mushrooms; put to them a very small quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of garlic, finely chopped; toss up over a brisk fire with a
little butter; add some lemon-juice; give them a few turns;
then add salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a wine-glassful of the
richest brown gravy (Grande Espagnole); when the mushrooms
are warmed through in this, add a couple of glasses of
Sauterne, simmer for ten minutes, and serve.</p>

<p>A homely mode of cooking <i>Ag. campestris</i> in Bucks. is to
cut up the buttons with pieces of bacon the size of dice, and
then to boil them in a dumpling.</p>

<h4><i>Method of Cultivating.</i></h4>

<p>The following method of cultivating mushrooms is given in
Paxton’s ‘Botanical Dictionary:’—</p>

<p>“Collect a sufficient quantity of fresh horse-droppings, as
free from straw as possible; lay it in an open shed in a heap
or ridge; here it will heat violently, and in consequence
should be now and then turned for sweetening; after this has
subsided to moderation, it will be in a fit state for forming
into a bed. In the process of making the bed, the dung
should be put on in small quantities and beat firmly and
equally together, until it is the required size; in this state let
it remain until the highest degree of heat to which it is capable
of coming is ascertained, which may be readily done by
inserting a heat-stick, and pressing it with the hand; if not
found violent, the spawn may be broken up into pieces of two
or three inches square, and put into holes about three inches
in depth by six inches asunder, over its surface; after this,
throw a very small quantity of well-broken droppings over the
whole. In this state let it remain for two or three weeks,
when a loamy soil may be put on about an inch or an inch
and a half thick, and gently patted with the spade. If the
temperature of the house be kept about sixty or sixty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
degrees, mushrooms may be expected in six weeks. It is not
well to water the beds much, particularly when bearing; it is
much better to throw a little water over the path and flues,
which will both improve the colour and the flavour of the
mushrooms, without being attended with those bad effects
frequently resulting from watering, viz. that of destroying
the young stock, and turning browner those already fit for
table.”—<i>Paxton’s Bot. Dict.</i></p>

<p>With regard to the spawn, it may be collected as recommended
in the French work cited by M. Roques, and kept
in a dry place till wanted; or by digging about the roots of
growing mushrooms, and carrying away the earth which contains
it. The <i>débris</i> of a former mushroom-bed will always
furnish spawn for a new.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“L’Agarico esquisito è un fungo sano, oltremodo delicato e di
facilissima digestione.”—<i>Vitt.</i></p>

<p>“Its flavour is far inferior to that of the common mushroom.”—<i>Berkeley.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This fungus, called also the Horse Mushroom, from the
enormous dimensions<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to which it sometimes attains, is for
the most part shunned by the English epicure; it is also this
species from which many persons report themselves to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
suffered indigestion attended with violent colicky pains, when
they have eaten it by mistake for the <i>Ag. campestris</i>. It is
sold, under the name of White Caps, for making ketchup; but,
notwithstanding its foreign name and reputation, most persons
will agree with Mr. Berkeley, in holding both its flesh
and its juices as greatly inferior to those of the <i>Ag. campestris</i>.
Our other name for it, that of St. George’s Agaric, can have
no reference to the time of its appearance, as it is seldom met
with in England till after that saint’s day; it has, moreover,
the same name in Hungary, where the inhabitants look upon
it as a special gift from Saint George.</p>

<p>Its botanical characters are the following:—</p>

<p><i>Pileus</i> at first conico-campanulate, covered with floccose
shreds, which are very fugacious; when fully expanded, minutely
squamulose, of a beautiful white, shining and smooth;
turning yellow when bruised, and sometimes exuding a yellow
juice (Sibthorpe). <i>Gills</i> numerous, broad, attenuated both
ways, but most so behind, free, of a pallid hue (grey flesh-colour),
during the growth of the fungus; later, clouded
brown-black; the imperfect gills obtuse behind. <i>Stem</i> long,
subcylindrical, slightly thickened at the base, white without,
stuffed within. <i>Ring</i> tumid and reflected over the stalk.
<i>Flesh</i> of both pileus and stalk compact, fibrous, and fragile.
Flavour and smell strong, and, according to Vittadini, agreeable,
but according to English perception generally the reverse.
Persoon pronounces this fungus to be <i>superior</i> to the
common mushroom in smell, taste, and digestibility, on which
accounts, he says, it is generally preferred in France. It is
to be cooked in the same way as that, and, if eaten in moderation,
will seldom be found to incommode the stomach or
offend the palate.</p>

<p><i>Locality.</i>—Pastures, amidst thickets, under trees, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in large rings, reproducing itself every year in the same
situations.</p>

<h3>AGARICUS DELICIOSUS.</h3>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate5"><span class="smcap">Plate V., Fig. 4.</span></a></p>

<p class="center"><i>Orange Milk Agaric.</i></p>

<p class="center">Subgenus <span class="smcap">Galorrheus</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> Gregarious. <i>Pileus</i> from three to four inches
across; colour dull orange-rufous, frequently zoned with concentric
circles of a brighter hue, fleshy, firm, full of red orange
milk, which turns green on exposure to the air (as does the
whole plant when bruised); the margin at first involute and
downy, then expanded, afterwards depressed. <i>Gills</i> decurrent,
forked at the base, always of the same colour as the
pileus, rather distant, substantial. <i>Stem</i> from two to three
inches high, slightly bent, stuffed in part, scrobiculate (<i>i. e.</i>
marked with little superficial pits); at the base strigose (<i>i. e.</i>
covered with short pointed hairs).</p>

<p>This is one of the best Agarics with which I am acquainted,
fully deserving both its <i>name</i> and the estimation in which it
is held abroad. Its flesh is firm, juicy, sapid, and nutritious.
It grows under old Scotch firs and pines, and occasionally in
considerable abundance, and is well worth the trouble of
searching for from September to the beginning of November,
when it is in season. There is but one fungus which it in
any way resembles, and as that one (<i>Ag. torminosus</i>) is acrid
and poisonous, the gatherer must pay particular attention to
the following characteristic difference between the two, viz.
that the milk of the <i>Ag. deliciosus</i> is <i>red and subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
turns green</i>, while that of the <i>Ag. torminosus</i> is <i>white</i> and <i>unchangeable</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Sowerby thus speaks in praise of this species:—“I
had one dressed; it was very luscious eating, full of rich
gravy, with a little of the flavour of mussels.”</p>

<p>Sir James Smith, in his ‘Tour,’ says:—“The market of
Marseilles exhibited a prodigious quantity of <i>Ag. deliciosus</i>,
which really deserves its name, being the most delicious mushroom
known.”</p>

<p>The <i>Agaricus deliciosus</i> may be served with a white sauce,
or fried; but the best way to cook them, after duly seasoning
with pepper and salt, and putting a piece of butter upon each,
is to bake (in a closely-covered pie-dish) for about three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<h3>BOLETUS SCABER, <i>Fries</i>.</h3>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate6"><span class="smcap">Plate VI. Figs. 1, 2.</span></a></p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“Fungo innocente e che non può cagionare alcun danno, non molto
ricercato a motivo, senza dubbio, del cambiamento di colore in cui va
soggetto la sua carne allorchè viene rotta o compressa.”—<i>Vitt.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> This fungus presents itself under two distinct
forms; in the first, the <i>B. aurantiacus</i> of Bull., the <i>pileus</i>
(generally rather downy, but sometimes rough) is of a beautiful
deep orange hue; in the other it is cinereous.</p>

<p>In both cases its shape is that of a hemisphere of from three
to seven inches across, the surface of which becomes viscid
when moist, and is minutely downy. In the first variety,
the <i>stem</i> is rough with black, in the second with orange
scales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Half a foot is its average height; it is attenuated upwards.
While young, it is very thick in proportion to the pileus, and
exhibits frequently the traces of a floccose veil. The flesh is
thick and flabby, of a dingy white, not greatly changeable in
young specimens, but deepening in colour when old, and acquiring
a vinous tint;<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the <i>tubes</i> are of a dirty white, those
that surround the stem being shorter than the rest.</p>

<p>The odour of this fungus is slight; the taste subacid; the
seminal dust copious, and tawny-ferruginous. It may be
cooked like the <i>B. edulis</i>, and has an agreeable flavour; but
being more viscid in substance, it requires when stewed to be
thinned with water; when dried, it loses all odour, and is then
insipid and unfit for food.</p>

<h3>BOLETUS LURIDUS.</h3>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate6"><span class="smcap">Plate VI. Figs. 3, 4, and 5.</span></a></p>

<p>Nothing can be more accurate than Mr. Berkeley’s description
of this species, which I therefore subjoin:—“Woods.
Summer and autumn. Common. <i>Pileus</i> two to six inches
broad, convex, expanded, minutely tomentose, olive, brick-red,
pinkish, cream-coloured, or ferruginous-brown. <i>Flesh</i>
more or less yellow, changing to blue.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> <i>Tubes</i> free, yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
or greenish; their orifices of a beautiful red or bright orange,
quite simple, round. <i>Spores</i> olivaceous-ochre. <i>Stem</i> very
variable in length, bulbous, tomentose, sometimes quite smooth,
red with ferruginous or the brightest yellow shades, solid,
generally more or less marked or reticulated with crimson-red,
<i>very deleterious</i>”(?<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>).</p>

<h3>AGARICUS PERSONATUS.</h3>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate1"><span class="smcap">Plate I. Fig. 2.</span></a></p>

<p class="center">Subgenus <span class="smcap">Tricholoma</span>, <i>Fries</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Blewitts.</i></p>

<p>I never met with this fungus in Italy; it has not been described
by Vittadini, nor, that I am aware of, by any Italian
mycologist; neither is it mentioned by Cordier or Roques, in
their treatises on the esculent funguses of France. Extremely
common in England, this species has already found its way to
Covent Garden, where, according to Sowerby, it is sold under
the name of “Blewitts.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The favourite haunt of the Blewitt
is amidst grass, where it grows in clusters, or in large rings,
seldom appearing before October.</p>

<p>The botanical characters, as given by Mr. Berkeley, are as
follows:—“<i>Pileus</i> from two to six inches broad, fleshy, firm;
pale bistre or purple-lilac, occasionally violet; convex, obtuse,
very smooth, and shining, as if oiled, but not viscid; margin
involute, pulverulento-tomentose. <i>Gills</i> rounded; free, narrow
in front, paler than the pileus, sometimes violet, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to a dirty flesh-colour, especially when bruised; <i>stem</i> from one
to three inches high, three-quarters of an inch thick, firm,
bulbous, solid, mottled within towards the apex, with watery
spots; clothed more or less with villous fibrillæ, tinged with
violet; odour like that of <i>Oreades</i>, but rather overpowering;
taste pleasant.” As the “Blewitt” is apt to imbibe in wet
weather a great quantity of moisture, it should not be gathered
during rain; when not water-soaked it is a fine firm fungus
with a flavour of veal, like which it is to be dressed <i>en papillottes</i>
with savoury herbs and the usual condiments, and the
more highly seasoned the better.</p>

<p>Every one knows the Champignon,—that little buff fungus
which during so many months in the year comes up in successive
crops, in great profusion after rain, and generally in
rings. These Champignons abound everywhere: this summer
(1847) Hyde Park was full of them; amid the seared and much-trodden
grass they were continually tracing their fairy rings,
and in some instances they reached the very border of the
gravel walks. Independent of the excellent flavour of this
little mushroom, which is as good as that of most funguses,
two circumstances give it an additional value in a domestic
point of view, viz. the facility with which it is dried, and its
very extensive dissemination. When dried (two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
days’ exposure to the air is generally sufficient to effect this),
the <i>Ag. oreades</i> may be kept for years without losing any of
its aroma or goodness, which on the contrary become improved
by the process, so as, in fact, to impart more flavour
to the dish than would have been imparted by the fresh
fungus; though it is not to be denied that the flesh then becomes
coriaceous and less easy of digestion.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> From the sad
accidents occasioned by persons mistaking other small and
poisonous Agarics growing in the neighbourhood of the
Champignon for the Champignon itself, this species is frequently
looked upon with suspicion, and not often eaten in
England. The Agaric the least unlike and most commonly
found growing in company with the <i>Ag. oreades</i>, is the <i>Ag.
semilobatus</i>, which is nearly allied to, if it be not the same as
the <i>Ag. virosus</i> of Sowerby. But as I have also heard of a
gentleman who intending to gather Champignons, and taking
home some <i>Ag. dryophilus</i> by mistake, was rendered very ill
by his repast, to prevent the recurrence of such mistakes for
the future, I here add the botanical characters, marking what
is peculiar to each in italics. <i>Ag. dryophilus</i> is represented in

<h4>AG. DRYOPHILUS.</h4>

white, or pale yellow straw-colour. Stem shining, <i>hollow</i>, of the same

<p>The following description was made from some among the
more characteristic specimens of a large supply which I
gathered this autumn (1847) near Hayes, from a spot where
they are in the habit of re-appearing regularly in October.</p>

<p><i>Pileus</i> from two and a half to five inches across; at first
depresso-convex; when expanded nearly flat or broadly subumbonate,
never depressed, margin at first involute and pruinose;
occasionally somewhat waved and lobed, but generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
regular in form; smooth, viscid when moist, so that dead
leaves adhere to it; grey, brown at the centre, paler towards
the circumference. <i>Flesh</i> thick, white, unchanging; <i>gills</i>
cream-colour, narrow, decurrent, close, their margins waved,
unequal, generally simple. <i>Stem</i> from two to four inches
long, from a quarter of an inch to an inch thick; incurved at
the base, not rooting, but attaching by means of a floccose
down, round its lower portion and for one-third of its length,
a large quantity of dead leaves, by which the plant is held
erect; subequal, more or less marked with longitudinal pits,
firm externally, within of a softer substance. The <i>odour</i>
strong, like that of curd cheese.</p>

<p>This Agaric appears to be local in Italy; otherwise it could
scarcely have been omitted in Vittadini’s work, nor by the
author of the article “Fungo” in the Venice edition of the
‘Dizionario Classico di Medicina:’ add to which that I have
never met with it myself either at Florence, Pisa, Naples, or
Leghorn. That it grows in the neighbourhood of Rome is
certain, since I find it admirably delineated in a curious collection
of very old drawings which I purchased there. Moreover
Professor Sanguinetti, of that city, writes in terms of
high commendation of this mushroom, which, he says, may be
discerned <i>inter alia</i>, “by its peculiar odour and grateful taste:
when properly cooked it is equal to any of our funguses, rivalling
not only the <i>Ag. prunulus</i>, but even the <i>Cæsareus</i>: as
few are aware of its good qualities, it seldom finds its way into
the Roman market.” The <i>Ag. nebularis</i> requires but little
cooking; a few minutes’ broiling (à la Maintenon is best),
with butter, pepper, and salt, is sufficient. It may also be
delicately fried with bread crumbs, or stewed in white sauce.
The flesh of this mushroom is perhaps lighter of digestion
than that of any other.</p>

given them to the cook at the Calverley Hotel to dress, I
learnt from the waiter that they were not novelties to him;
that, in fact, he had been in the habit of dressing them for
years, on state occasions, at the Freemasons’ Tavern. They
were generally fetched, so he said, from, the neighbourhood of
Chelmsford, and were always well paid for. Of the <i>Cantharellus</i>,
this summer (1847), the supplies were immense! the
moss under the beech-trees in Buckhurst Park in particular,
was so lavish of them, that a hamper might soon have
been filled, had there been hands to gather them. On revisiting
the same park about five weeks later, they were still
continuing to come up, but in less abundance.</p>

<p>The botanical characters of the <i>Cantharellus</i> are as follow:—</p>

<p>When young, its <i>stalk</i> is tough, white, and solid; but as it
grows this becomes hollow and presently changes to yellow;
tapering below, it is effused into the substance of the <i>pileus</i>,
which is of the same colour with it. The <i>pileus</i> is lobed, and
irregular in shape, its margin at first deeply involute, afterwards
when expanded, wavy. The <i>veins</i> or plaits are thick,
subdistant, much sinuated, running some way down the stalk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The <i>flesh</i> is white, fibrous, dense, “having the odour of apricots”
(<i>Purton</i>), or of “plums” (<i>Vitt.</i>). The <i>colour</i> yellow,
that of the yolk of eggs, is deeper on the under surface; when
raw it has the pungent taste of pepper; the <i>spores</i> which are
elliptic, are of a pallid ochre colour (<i>Vitt.</i>).<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The <i>Chantarelle</i>
grows sometimes sporadically, sometimes in circles or segments
of a circle, and may be found from June to October. At first
it assumes the shape of a minute cone; next, in consequence
of the rolling in of the margin, the pileus is almost spherical,
but as this unfolds, it becomes hemispherical, then flat, at
length irregular and depressed.</p>

<p>“This fungus,” observes Vittadini, “being rather dry and
tough by nature, requires a considerable quantity of fluid
sauce to cook it properly.” The common people in Italy dry
or pickle, or keep it in oil for winter use. Perhaps the best
ways of dressing the <i>Cantharellus</i> are to stew or mince it
by itself, or to combine it with meat or with other funguses.
It requires to be gently stewed and a long time to make
it tender; but by soaking it in milk the night before, less
cooking will be requisite.</p>

<p>The <i>Canth. cibarius</i> is very abundant about Rome, where it
fetches, not being in great esteem, from twopence to twopence
halfpenny a pound.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that those who gather funguses
for the table, should be accurately acquainted with the
different species composing this genus; its members are so
abundantly distributed; some of them form so excellent and
delicate a food, whilst others produce such deleterious effects
on the economy, that they are well entitled to a diligent and
careful attention. The limits of this work will not permit an
accurate discrimination of all the species, which would require
a long monograph to themselves; but I have endeavoured
to point out amidst those of most frequent occurrence, the
three which may be selected with profit for the table, and
some others which are nearly allied, from which we must be
careful to separate them.</p>

<p>The three mild-flavoured <i>Russulæ</i> are the <i>Ag. heterophyllus</i>,
<i>Ag. ruber</i>, and <i>Ag. virescens</i>; the botanical characters of the
first are as follows:—</p>

<h5><i>Ag. heterophyllus.</i></h5>

<p><i>Pileus</i> subirregular, from three and a half to four and a half
inches across, at first convex, then more or less excavated
towards the centre; for the most part smooth, the epidermis
covering it, more or less moist, never scored or fissured, but
exhibiting a continuous surface, marked by very small raised
lines, radiating as from the centre, and frequently crossing so
as to present a very minute finely reticulated meshwork, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
slightly zoned, adhering to the flesh of the <i>pileus</i>, which
peels away with it in flakes resembling asbestos. It is very
various in colour, being found of all shades of yellow, lilac,
azure, green, and sometimes a mixture of these in different
parts. The margin even, <i>i. e.</i> not striate, irregularly elevated
and depressed. The <i>gills</i> are watery white, rather numerous
and thick, ascending, tapering away at their stalk extremity,
rather broader at the other, some simple but many of them
forked at the base, in a few instances branched; the imperfect
gills very few, irregular, occasionally broadly adhering to the
side of a perfect gill; the <i>stalk</i> naked, variable as to length
and size, equal or attenuated slightly at the base, white like
spermaceti, externally rugulose, and meshed, like the pileus,
with minute meandering lines, internally stuffed with a compact
subfriable medullary substance, which, as the fungus
grows old, breaks up here and there into sinuses which gradually
coalesce, till at last the whole stem becomes hollow. The
parenchyma is compact, but not thick, and does not change
colour when cut. The spores white, round, and very abundant.
The <i>taste</i> sweet and nutty. <i>Odour</i> none.</p>

<p>This excellent fungus, which Vittadini pronounces to be
not surpassed for fineness of flavour by <i>Am. Cæsarea</i> or by <i>B.
edulis</i>, with either of which it is equally wholesome, has been
introduced by Roques into the houses of many of his friends
in the environs of Paris, some of whom prefer it to <i>Ag. campestris</i>:
an opinion shared by several of our own friends on
this side the Channel. It grows in great abundance during
the summer months generally, and this year nowhere more
plentifully than under the Elm-trees in Kensington Gardens.
There must be no delay in dressing it, otherwise insects, who
are as fond of it as we are, appropriate it to their larvæ, which
in a few hours will utterly consume it; the flesh, being very
tender, requires but slight cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Agaricus ruber</i>, Schœffer. <i>Ag. griseus</i>, Persoon.</h5>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“L’Agarico Rosso è uno dei funghi più delicati e gustosi che si
conoscono.”—<i>Vitt.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> rather fleshy, at first hemispherical, then
obtusely convex, and, when fully expanded, more or less excavated
towards the centre. The margins at first even, at length
tuberculo-sulcate, that is, marked with lines similar to those
left on the skin after cupping. The epidermis dry in dry
weather, but very sticky in moist, of various hues, tawny-purple,
olive-green, ochraceous-yellow, or several of these
united, and generally darkest at the centre; peeling off readily
without laceration of the flesh. The flesh white, when cut
slightly rufescent, when dry cream-coloured. The <i>gills</i> fragile,
cream-coloured, connected below by transverse plaits or veins,
thick and broad, but tapering away towards the stalk, really
simple, though a few imperfect gills interposed between the
entire ones, and attaching themselves to their sides give these
sometimes the appearance of being forked; the <i>stalk</i> equal,
white, or blotched here and there with purple stains, stuffed,
brittle, and Vittadini adds, “long,” which is not my experience
of it; when young it is so short as to be entirely hid by
the globose head of the unexpanded pileus. The flesh inconsiderable
but compact; <i>sporules</i> pale-buff.</p>

<p>The <i>Ag. ruber</i>, the <i>Colombo rossa</i> of the Tuscans, and <i>Rother
Täubling</i> of Schœffer, is a complete <i>wood</i>-pigeon in its haunts;
it grows very abundantly, may be gathered from July to a
very late period in the autumn, and is as delicate and light of
digestion as the <i>Russula</i> last described. It may be readily
distinguished from <i>Ag. alutaceus</i> by the different colour of its
gills and spores, which in that species are buff, but in the <i>Ag.
ruber</i> cream-coloured: moreover the greater thickness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
substance of the pileus of <i>Ag. alutaceus</i>, the margin of which
is deeply sulcate, even at an early period of its development,
and the pungent acrid taste, which is seldom wanting, are
further means of distinguishing it from <i>Ag. ruber</i>. <i>Ag. emeticus</i>
differs from it in having unequal snow-white gills, and in
extreme acrimony of taste.</p>

<h5><i>Agaricus virescens</i>, Schœff.: the Verdette? <i>Ag. bifidus</i>, Bull.

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“La carne di questo Agarico è tenera e di sapore gratissimo.”—<i>Vitt.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Pileus</i> at first flatly convex; at length depressed towards
the centre with an even margin; epidermis whitish, fibrous,
continuous and firmly adhering to the flesh, dry, but coated
over with a thick stratum of opaque meal, which gradually
breaking as the pileus expands maps it in a singular and quite
characteristic manner with a series of irregular polygonal
figures, in greater or less relief according to the thickness of
the coating; its colour varies slightly but is generally made
up of some admixture of green and yellow, communicating to
the surface, as Bulliard has remarked, a farinaceous or mouldy
appearance. The <i>gills</i> of some thickness, very brittle, white,
sublanceolate, generally simple, but occasionally forked, the
imperfect gills interspersed without order amongst the entire
ones; the <i>stalk</i> equal, short, its centre stuffed with cottony
fibres: somewhat compact and elastic. According to Thore,
as quoted by Persoon, this Agaric may be cultivated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>It is an exceedingly delicate fungus, but not very common
in England. The best way of cooking it, according to Vittadini,
is on the gridiron; the peasants about Milan are in the
habit of putting it over wood embers to toast, eating it afterwards
with a little salt, in which way it has a savoury smell,
and a taste like that of the <i>Cancer astacus</i>; when fresh it is
without odour, but acquires a very strong one while drying,
which he compares to that of salt meat. Mr. Berkeley quotes
Roques’ authority as to its being eaten in France; Vittadini,
without giving any authority, states that it is eaten in England.
It loses but little of its volume in drying.</p>

<h4>ACRID RUSSULÆ. RUSSULÆ ACRES, <span class="smcapuc">AUCT.</span></h4>

<h5><i>Agaricus alutaceus</i>, Persoon.</h5>

<p>Three acrid <i>Russulæ</i> remain to be described, <i>Ag. alutaceus</i>,
<i>Ag. emeticus</i>, <i>Ag. sanguineus</i>; all three common, though not
perhaps so common as the mild ones, and all to be avoided.
The first, <i>A. alutaceus</i>, Fries, is ranked by Vittadini among
the safe kinds, he even affixes a misplaced note of admiration
after his epithet “esculentus!” and describes it even when
raw as “a dainty food, possessed of a most agreeable flavour.”</p>

<p>Mr. Berkeley, who reports it esculent when <i>young</i>, remarks
that individual specimens occur, which prove almost as acrid
as the <i>Ag. emeticus</i> itself; my own experience of it in England
is, that whether young or old, it is always acrid when raw.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
I have never tried it dressed, which might possibly extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
its noxious qualities, as Vittadini reports to have been the
case with a caustic variety which he subjected to this test;
but since even then, on his own showing, it proved indigestible,
I would advise no one to try this species, especially
when there are so many others, the good qualities of which are
known.</p>

<p>It is easy to distinguish <i>A. alutaceus</i> from any of the foregoing
species; to do this it is only necessary to look at the
gills, which, in place of being, as in these, white, watery white,
or cream-coloured, are of a rich buff; <i>pileus</i> about three inches
broad, pink or livid olive, smooth on the surface, and viscid in
wet weather; the margin at first even, but in age striate; the
<i>gills</i> broad, equal, slightly forked, ventricose, free, connected
by veins; the <i>sporules</i> rich buff; the <i>stem</i> one and a half inches
long, blunt, surface longitudinally wrinkled or grooved, solid
without, spongy within, varying from white to buff.</p>

<h5><i>Agaricus emeticus</i>, Schœffer.</h5>

<p>Reports concerning the qualities of this fungus differ widely,
some asserting it to be a most deleterious species, of which
the mischief was not to be removed by cooking, whilst others,
on the authority of dogs whom they persuaded to eat some,
pronounced it innoxious. In this state of uncertainty Vittadini,
for the sake of science, and peradventure of adventure
also, determined to test its effects upon himself; he had previously
given at different times large doses, of from six to
twelve ounces, to dogs, both in the crude state and also
cooked; but without result. “Still,” says he,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> “thinking that
though dogs might eat <i>Ag. emeticus</i> with impunity, it might yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
prove injurious to man, I took five specimens of fair dimensions,
and having fried, I ate them with the usual condiments;
but though pains were taken to have them delicately prepared
(<i>oltimamente cucinati</i>), they still retained their acrid bitter
taste, and were most distasteful to the palate.” The reader
will be glad to learn, that the only inconvenience suffered by
this bold self-experimentalist was a slight sense of præcordial
uneasiness accompanied with flatulence,—effects attributable
entirely, as he believed, to the rich mode in which his dish
was prepared: though, more timid apparently for others’
safety than his own, he particularly adds, “though I have
clearly established to my own satisfaction, the complete innocuousness
of the <i>A. emeticus</i>; still, as there are, or are said to
be, other <i>Russulæ</i> of highly deleterious properties and closely
allied, the mistaking which for it might be paid for by the
loss of life, the safer rule is to abstain from all such as have
acrid juices.”</p>

<p>The botanical characters of <i>Ag. emeticus</i> are as follow:—</p>

<p>Pileus more or less rosy, flesh compact, margin striate, epidermis
adherent; <i>gills</i> very brittle, arched in front, attenuated
towards the stalk, connected below by transverse plaits, generally
simple, a few forked, the imperfect gills rounded off behind;
the <i>stalk</i>, which is compact, of equal dimensions, and
white, is generally more or less stained with red spots of the
same hue as the pileus; in the growing fungus, where the
epidermis has been removed and the flesh eaten by insects,
this soon acquires a tint as lively as that of the skin itself;
generally I have remarked that the erosions of insects and
slugs do <i>not</i> produce any change of colour, even in the species
notorious under other circumstances for manifesting such
a change; thus the flesh of the <i>Ag. rubescens</i>, which turns
red when it is divided, may be frequently seen half eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
through, exhibiting a white flesh; and the same is the case
with the <i>Boletus luridus</i>, the flesh of which, though eroded,
remains white till it is broken through.</p>

<h5><i>Ag. sanguineus</i>, Bull.</h5>

<p>This fungus, of which the general facies and most of the
botanical characters, as well as the taste and other qualities,
are similar to those of the last-mentioned Agaric, differs from
it in having its gills for the most part forked, many smaller
ones being interposed between those that are entire, also in
<i>not</i> having its margin striate, as the <i>Ag. emeticus</i> when moderately
expanded always has. The smell of this fungus,
which is only developed in drying, is, according to Vittadini,
“most agreeable,” resembling that of fresh meal; to me its
odour is unpleasant and like that of sour paste.</p>

<h5><i>Ag. acris minor.</i></h5>

<p><i>Pileus</i> one or two inches across, sticky, of a light muddy-pink,
the <i>epidermis</i> peeling off easily and entire from the flesh,
margin not striate, flesh soft, white, and cellular; <i>gills</i> adnate,
white, forked, brittle, slightly ventricose; the margin subdenticulate;
the <i>stalk</i> of spermaceti-whiteness and appearance,
solid within, brittle, the internal texture looser than the external;
the surface minutely rugulose, 1¼-1½ inch, by 2-4 lines
thick, intensely acrid. In meadows, throughout the summer;
abundant.</p>

Season, spring and autumn.</p>

<p>As there are some singular differences presented by this
fungus in regard to development, odour, taste, and the colour
of the spores, which seem almost sufficient to entitle it to be
divided into two distinct species, I shall first describe the more
ordinary form, as given by Mr. Berkeley, and then mention
the variations from it.</p>

<p>“Imbricated, large; <i>pileus</i> subdimidiate, very thick and
fleshy; flesh white, dusky towards the surface; one inch
deep, the border at first fibrillose; margin involute, as the
pileus expands the white fibrillæ vanish, and the colour
changes to bistre; margin paler and rimulose, the whole surface
shining and satiny when dry, soft and clammy when moist;
<i>gills</i> broad, here and there forked,”<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> standing out sharp and
erect like the fine flutings of a column, winding down the
stalk to different lengths, and those that reach the bottom
forming there a beautiful raised meshwork highly characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of this species, “<i>dirty</i> (pure?) white, the edge serrated,
umber; <i>taste</i> and <i>smell</i> like that of <i>Ag. personatus</i>, which it
resembles somewhat in colour;” “<i>spores</i> white like those of
the <i>Polyporus suaveolens</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The points of difference in those
which departed from the ordinary type were as follows:<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>—first,
in specimens growing close together and all equally exposed
to the light, the colour of all at the same period of growth
was not the same, being a delicate waxy-white in some of the
specimens, in others, a light-brown. Secondly, whereas this
fungus is generally “invested during infancy with a <i>white
lanugo or down</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> I observed the young Agarics, which presented
themselves at first as small semitransparent eminences
rising irregularly from a common stalk, and not unlike in appearance
the blisters on a chalcedony, to be thickly coated
with a light-blue varnish in place of it; the dry <i>débris</i> of
which varnish continued to adhere to the surface of the pileus
for some time afterwards. Thirdly, the complexion of the
spores, commonly described as <i>white</i>, was in these specimens
pale-rose. Fourthly, they exhaled the strong and peculiar
odour of Tarragon; and, finally, in place of being the delicate
fungus at table which in July I had always found it, these
specimens afforded a distasteful food. The <i>Ag. ostreatus</i> resists
cold in a remarkable manner; the circumstance of its
being found in winter has procured for it the trivial name of
Gelon. <i>Ag. ostreatus</i> is found on the barks of many sorts of
trees, and wherever it has once been it is apt to recur frequently
afterwards. It may be dressed in any of the more
usual ways; but as the flesh is rather over-solid and tenacious,
it is all the better for being cooked leisurely over a slow fire.</p>

<p>This is a very delicate fungus, which grows in sufficient

view. It makes excellent ketchup. Cordier reports it as one
of the most delicate mushrooms of the Lorraine; and Roques
speaks equally well of it. It generally grows in woods, particularly
of oak and chestnut, both in summer and autumn.

generally known that this fungus, though by no means so
common with us as some others, (a circumstance partly attributable
to the prevailing ignorance as to when and where
to look for it, or even of its being indigenous to England,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>)
occurs not unfrequently in our orchards and woods, towards
the beginning of summer. Roques reports favourably of some
specimens sent to him by the Duke of Athol; and others,
from different parts of the country, occasionally find their
way into Covent Garden market. The genus <i>Morchella</i> comprises
very few species, and they are all good to eat. Persoon
remarks, that though the Morell rarely appears in a sandy
soil, preferring a calcareous or argillaceous ground, it frequently
springs up on sites where charcoal has been burnt or
where cinders have been thrown.</p>

<h4><i>Morchella esculenta.</i></h4>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> very various in shape and hue, the surface
broken up into little sinuses or cells, made by folds or
plaits of the hymenium, which are more or less salient, and
constitute the so-called ribs. These <i>ribs</i> are very irregular,
and anastomose with each other throughout; the pileus hollow,
opening into the irregular hollow stem. <i>Spores</i> pale-yellow.</p>

<h4><i>Morchella semilibera.</i></h4>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> This may be known from the <i>M. esculenta</i> by
being, as its name imports, half free, <i>i. e.</i> having the pileus
for half its length detached from the stalk. Spores are pale-yellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>

<p>M. Roques says the Morell may be dressed in a variety of
ways, both fresh and dry, with butter or in oil, <i>au gras</i> or <i>à
la crême</i>. The following receipts for cooking them are from
Persoon.</p>

<p>1st. Having washed and cleansed them from the earth
which is apt to collect between the plaits, dry thoroughly in a
napkin, and put them into a saucepan with pepper, salt, and
parsley, adding or not a piece of ham; stew for an hour, pouring
in occasionally a little broth to prevent burning; when
sufficiently done, bind with the yolks of two or three eggs,
and serve on buttered toast.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>Morelles à l’Italienne.</i>—Having washed and dried,
divide them across, put them on the fire with some parsley,
scallion, chervil, burnet, tarragon, chives, a little salt, and
two spoonfuls of fine oil. Stew till the juice runs out; then
thicken with a little flour; serve with bread-crumbs and a
squeeze of lemon.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>Stuffed Morells.</i>—Choose the freshest and whitest
Morells, open the stalk at the bottom; wash and wipe them
well, fill with veal stuffing, anchovy, or any rich <i>farce</i> you
please, securing the ends, and dressing between thin slices of
bacon. Serve with a sauce like the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>“The general use made of this fungus throughout France, Italy, and
Germany leaves no doubt as to its good qualities.”—<i>Roques.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> fleshy, tawny, red, smoothly tomentose,
very irregular in shape, from two to five inches across, lobed
or undulated; margin vaulted, acute, wavy; flesh white,
turning yellow when cut, if bruised becoming brown-red;
<i>spines</i> pale-yellow, unequal, thick-set, apices canino-denticulate
or conical, straight or slightly ungulate; occasionally bifid;
shorter and more obtuse towards the stalk, on the upper part
of which they are somewhat decurrent, leaving small foraminules
when detached; <i>stem</i> at first white, then tawny; two
inches long, solid, of variable thickness (from half an inch to
two inches) more or less flattened, papillated above with the
rudiments of spines which have aborted; <i>spores</i> round, white,
<i>taste</i> when raw at first pleasant, but presently of a saline
bitter, like Glauber salts, somewhat peppery, and <i>smell</i> like
that of horse-radish.</p>

<p>This fungus occurs principally in woods, and especially in
those of pine and oak; sometimes solitary, but more frequently
in company and in rings. In Italy (where the spines
have procured for it the name of “Steccherino,” or Hedgehog),
it is brought into the market and sold promiscuously
with the Chantarelle, to which in colour and in some other
respects it bears a resemblance. There is no fungus with
which this is likely to be confounded; once seen, it is recognized
at a glance afterwards, and may be gathered fearlessly.</p>

<p>According to Paulet, Persoon, and Vittadini, the <i>Hyd. repandum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
should be cooked for a long time, and with plenty of
sauce, otherwise, being deficient in moisture, it is apt to become
rather tough; when well stewed it is an excellent dish,
with a slight flavour of oysters; it makes also a very good
<i>purée</i>. Vittadini places it among the most delicate of the
funguses of Italy.</p>

<p>“Fungus pauperibus esculentus.”—<i>Schœff.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This fungus, which, in the earlier stages of its development,
frequently resembles very closely a tongue in shape, structure,
and general appearance, presents later a dark, amorphous,
grumous-looking mass, bearing a still more striking likeness
to liver. Thus, seen while young, and just beginning to bud
out from the oak,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> its papillated surface, regular shape, and
clear fibrous flesh make it an object of interest to many who,
introduced to it at an advanced period of growth, can hardly
be brought to believe that the blackened misshapen mass, that
looks like liver, and that deeply stains the fingers with an unsightly
red fluid, can indeed be the same plant. It has, from
the earliest-recorded accounts, been designated by names
pointing to these resemblances: Cesalpinus calls it <i>Linguæ</i>;
Wallemb, <i>Buglossus quercinus</i>; the vulgar name in Italy is
“Lingua quercina,” or “Lingua di castagna.” It constitutes
a genus by itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> confluent with the stalk: at first studded
on the upper side with minute papillæ (the rudiments of tubes),
which afterwards disappear; flesh succulent, fibrous, like beetroot
in appearance, with a vinous smell and a slight acid
taste; <i>tubes</i> continuous with the fibres of the receptacle, unequal,
very short, small, cylindrical, ochraceous-rufescent; at
first with closed pores, but as they elongate they become
patent; colour at first a dry dusky white, afterwards a
yellowish-red; the whole surface more or less sticky, with a
gelatinous secretion exuding from it; <i>sporidia</i> ochraceous-green,
and matured at different times from the unequal length
of the tubes. This fungus varies in size from that of a small
kidney to an irregular mass of many pounds’ weight, and of
several feet in circumference. I recently picked a specimen
which measured nearly five feet round, and weighed upwards of
eight pounds; but this is nothing to one found by Mr. Graves,
which, on the authority of Mr. Berkeley, weighed nearly
thirty pounds.</p>

<p>The <i>Fistulina hepatica</i>, which Schœffer calls the Poor Man’s
fungus, “fungus pauperibus esculentus,” deserves indeed the
epithet if we look to its abundance, which makes it an acquisition
to the labouring class wherever it is known; but that it
is in any other sense fitted for the poor, or to be eaten by
those only who can purchase no other food, is what I cannot
subscribe to. No fungus yields a richer gravy, and though
rather tough, when grilled it is scarcely to be distinguished
from broiled meat. The best way to dress it if old, is to stew
it down for stock, and reject the flesh, but if young, it may
be eaten in substance, plain, or with minced meat; in all
cases its succulency is such that it furnishes its own sauce,
which a friend of ours, well versed in the science of the table,
declares each time he eats it to be “undeniably good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In England the <i>F. hepatica</i> grows principally on old oak-trees,
and may be found throughout the summer in great
abundance.</p>

<p>“Esculentus!”—<i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This is a very delicate mushroom; it grows either solitary
or in company, and sometimes in rings, succeeding occasionally
a crop of <i>Ag. oreades</i> and <i>Ag. prunulus</i> which had
recently occupied the same site. Its general appearance,
once recognized, is such as to render the mistaking it for any
other species afterwards unlikely, whilst the least attention to
its botanical characters makes it impossible to do so. Its
irregular lobed pileus with smooth undulated borders, its decurrent
gills, and short solid stem are so many particulars in
which at first it might seem to resemble in outline the <i>Canth.
cib.</i>, with which it has, however, nothing else in common.
It bears a nearer general resemblance to several of the section
<i>Lactifluus</i> of Persoon, but the exudation, or not, of milk
would be conclusive in any doubtful case, to say nothing of its
peculiar smell of cucumber rind, or syringa leaf,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> in which
respect it resembles no other fungus. The surface is as soft
and smooth to the touch as kid, except in wet weather, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
it becomes more or less sticky; the size, which does not admit
of much variation, is from two to three inches across; whilst
young the borders are rolled inwards towards the gills, the
stalk is in the centre, and somewhat enlarged at the base;
but as the fungus grows the borders unroll themselves, one
side grows more rapidly than the other, the stalk becomes, in
consequence, eccentric, and this eccentricity is often rendered
greater by a lateral twist towards the base. The gills, which
at first are white, assume later a pale salmon hue; Berkeley
adds that “they are more or less forked, covered with very
minute conical papillæ ending in four spiculæ;” those that
are entire taper away posteriorly and terminate on the stalk,
but the imperfect ones are rounded off midway; the spores
are elliptic, and of the colour of brown-holland.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>This mushroom is found occasionally, throughout the summer,
but autumn is the season to look for it, amidst the grass
of woods and pastures, where it abounds. It should be eaten
the day it is gathered, either stewed, broiled, or fried with egg
and bread-crumbs, like cutlets. When dried, it loses much of
its volume and acquires “a very sweet smell,”—“un’ aroma
suavissimo” (<i>Vitt.</i>).</p>

<p>All <i>Helvellæ</i> are esculent, have an agreeable odour, and bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a general resemblance in flavour to the <i>Morell</i>. The <i>Helvella

uncommon,”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and the <i>Helvella lacunosa</i>, or cinereous Helvella
of Afzel (on each of whose heads respectively Sowerby and
Schœffer place an <i>inappropriate</i> mitre), are both indigenous.
They are thus succinctly but excellently described by Mr.

<p>This <i>Helvella</i> is not so common as the last, neither is it so
sapid. They both grow in woods and on the stumps of old
trees. Bendiscioli places them, for flavour, before the <i>Morell</i>,
but this is not the general opinion entertained of them.</p>

<p class="center">Tribe <span class="smcap">Cupulati</span>.</p>

<p>These funguses are very similar in their properties to the
<i>Helvellæ</i>; that is, are not to be despised when one cannot get
better, nor to be eaten when one can. “The <i>Verpa</i>,” says
Vittadini, “though sold in the market, is only to be recommended
when no other esculent fungus offers, which is sometimes
the case in spring.” The <i>Peziza acetabulum</i> is utterly
insipid, and depends entirely for flavour upon the sauce in
which it is served. As they are rare in England, I shall
merely give the botanical character of each.</p>

mouth puckered, tough; <i>stem</i> half to one inch high, smooth,
deeply but irregularly costato-lacunose, ribs solid “branching
at the top and forming reticulations on the outside of the cup,
so as to present the appearance of a cluster of pillars supporting

<h3>POLYPORUS FRONDOSUS, <i>Schrank</i>.</h3>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate4"><span class="smcap">Plate IV. Fig. 1.</span></a></p>

<p>There are many species of <i>Polyporus</i> eaten on the Continent;
among the more common kinds to be mentioned are
<i>P. frondosus</i> and <i>P. tuberaster</i>, Persoon, <i>P. corylinus</i>, Mauri,
<i>P. subsquamosus</i>, Pers., <i>P. giganteus</i>, ibid., <i>P. fomentarius</i>, ibid.,
which last is the Amadou, or German tinder fungus. Two
of these are local; the <i>P. tuberaster</i>, which occurs principally
in the kingdom of Naples, and the <i>P. corylinus</i> or that of the
cob-nut tree, which (though it might perhaps be cultivated
elsewhere) is at present restricted to Rome; both these are
excellent for food.</p>

<p>As to the <i>Polyporus squamosus</i>, which is as common in
England as abroad, in substance it cannot be masticated, and
its expressed juice is exceedingly disagreeable; I should not
think the <i>P. fomentarius</i>, to judge from its texture, promised
much better; nor <i>P. giganteus</i>, of which the flesh is sometimes
so tough as to creak under the knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The true <i>P. frondosus</i> is probably rare in England, that
which I have met with and have had cooked, without being
able to say much in its favour, is the <i>P. intybaceus</i> of Fries,
which Mr. Berkeley says is distinguished from the other by
having larger pores. Vittadini has not included it among the
esculent funguses in his work; Persoon does not recommend
it for weak stomachs on account of its toughness.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Paulet,
indeed, is of a different opinion, telling us that in place of its
being heavy for the stomach, <i>he</i> will feel all the lighter who
sups upon it. The people in the Vosges seem to have an equal
affection for it with this writer, giving it the somewhat whimsical,
though really most graphic <i>sobriquets</i> of the Hen-of-the-Woods
and the Breeding Hen (Mougeot). Professor Sanguinetti
informs me that it sells for six or seven baiocchi in
the Roman market, the finer specimens being sent as surprise
presents, “per meraviglia,” from poor tenants to hard landlords.</p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> “<i>Pilei</i> very numerous, dimidiate, condensed
into a convex tuft from half a foot to a foot broad, imbricated,
variously confluent, irregular, at first downy, dusky, then
smooth, livid grey; disk depressed, dilated above, from half
to one inch broad, convex, the base confluent with the compound
stem” (<i>Fries</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>All the funguses of this genus being esculent, enter more
or less largely into the supplies of the Italian markets. Roques
describes seven species; Persoon five; Vittadini gives a detailed
account and drawings of three, selecting those principally
for the superiority of their flavour over the rest, and because
of their greater abundance in the Milanese district.
Mr. Berkeley, in a list with which he has favoured me, enumerates
four British species as esculent, <i>C. coralloides</i>, <i>C. grisea</i>,
<i>C. cristata</i>, and <i>C. rugosa</i>; as, however, he has no
personal experience of any of these as articles of food, I
shall merely give the botanical character of the <i>C. coralloides</i>,
the most abundant of all the species (for the excellent
qualities of which I can myself vouch), furnishing the reader
with one or two drawings of other sorts, in further illustration
of this elegant genus.</p>

<h4><i>Clavaria coralloides.</i></h4>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> erect, white; <i>stem</i> rather thick, branches
unequal, elongated, mostly acute, pure white, sometimes violet
at the base.</p>

<h5><i>Mode of Dressing.</i></h5>

<p>Having thoroughly cleansed away the earth, which is apt
to adhere to them, they are to be sweated with a little butter,
over a slow fire, afterwards to be strained, then (throwing
away the liquor) to be replaced to stew for an hour, with salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
pepper, chopped chives and parsley, moistening with plain
stock, and dredging with flour occasionally. When sufficiently
cooked, to be thickened with yolks of eggs and cream.</p>

<h5><i>Another Mode.</i></h5>

<p>Proceed as before; after sweating the <i>Clavarias</i>, wrap them
in bacon and stew in a little broth seasoned with salt, pepper,
parsley, and ham; cook for an hour, then serve in white
sauce, or with a <i>fricassée</i> of chicken.</p>

<p>N.B.—The saucepan should be covered with a sheet of paper
under the lid, which keeps the <i>Clavarias</i> white and also preserves
their flavour.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that our woods, properly explored,
would be found to abound in funguses hitherto considered
rare, and this would probably be one of them. At present
the weald of Kent, within forty miles of London, remains, so
far as Mycology is concerned, nearly as unexplored as the interior
of Africa.</p>

with a membranaceous covering, and filled when young with
a white, compact, homogeneous pulp, which we call Puff-balls,
are good to eat; those in most request for the table abroad,
and the best, have no stem, <i>i. e.</i> no sterile base, but are prolific
throughout their whole substance. One of the most
common of these is the <i>Lycoperdon plumbeum</i>, of which the
following excellent description is chiefly taken from Vittadini.</p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> Body globose; when full-grown about the size
of a walnut, invested with two<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> tunics, the outer one white,
loosely membranaceous and fragile, sometimes smooth, at
others furfuraceous; the innermost one (peridium) very tenacious,
smooth, of a grey-lead colour externally, internally
more or less shaggy with very fine hairs; these hairs occupy
the whole cavity, and in the midst of them a prodigious number
of minute granular bodies, the sporules (each of which is
furnished with a long caudiform process), lie entangled. The
whole plant, carefully removed from the earth, with its root
still adhering, is in form not unlike one of its own seeds
vastly magnified.</p>

<p>The <i>L. plumbeum</i> abounds in dry places, and is to be found
in spring, summer, and autumn, solitary or in groups. “This,”
says Vittadini, “is one of our commonest Puff-balls, and after
the warm rains of summer and of autumn, myriads of these
little plants suddenly springing up will often completely cover
a piece of ground as if they had been sown like grain, for a
crop; if we dig them up we shall find that they are connected
with long fragile threads, extending horizontally underground
and giving attachment to numerous smaller Puff-balls in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

afford fresh supplies as the old ones die off.”</p>

</div>

<p>This differs from the last-mentioned Puff-ball in many particulars;
in the first place it is much larger (sometimes attaining
to vast dimensions), its shape is different, being that of
an inverted cone; never globular, the flesh also is more compact,
while the membrane which holds what is first the pulp
and afterwards the seed, is very thin and tender; the seed,
moreover, has no caudal appendage; and finally, a considerable
portion of the base is sterile, in all which additional particulars
it is unlike the <i>Lycoperdon plumbeum</i>. The plant is
sessile, a purple-black fragile membrane contains the spores,
which are also sessile,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and of the same colour as the peridium.</p>

<p>No fungus requires to be eaten so soon after gathering as
this; a few hours will destroy the compactness of the flesh

but when perfectly fresh and properly prepared, it yields to

<p>This is a nauseous, disagreeable fungus, however cooked,
and merely finds mention here, as its omission in a work on
the esculent funguses of England might seem strange to
those unacquainted with its demerits; it is really extraordinary
how some Continental writers, speaking from their own
experience, should ever have recommended it for the table.
Pliny’s general <i>apage</i> against all funguses really finds an application
to this, which is so repugnant to our notions of the
savoury, that few would make a second attempt, or get dangerously
far in a first dish. Not to be poisonous is its only
recommendation; for as to the inviting epithet <i>melleus</i>, or
honeyed, by which it is designated, this alludes only to the
colour, and by no means to the taste, which is both harsh
and styptic.</p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> In tufts, near or upon stumps of trees, or posts.
Pileus dirty-yellow, more or less hairy; <i>stem</i> fibrous, varying
greatly in length, from one inch to nine or ten; enlarged
above and below, thinner in the middle; <i>ring</i> thick, spreading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
rough or leathery; <i>gills</i> somewhat decurrent, deeper
than the pileus; <i>spores</i> white, appearing like fine dust on
the gills.</p>

<p>“Fungo mangiativo sommamente ricercato e di ottima qualità.”—<i>Vitt.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> Solitary or connected to others by a common
root; the <i>pileus</i> presenting a dirty-white surface, turning
afterwards to a pale rust-colour, and sometimes tessellated;
varying like all parasitical funguses in shape, but generally
more or less orbicular; flesh continuous with the stalk, white,
compact; <i>stalk</i> very thick, solid, elastic, smooth towards the
summit, tomentose at the base; <i>gills</i> of a yellowish tint,
broad, thick, ventricose, emarginate, <i>i. e.</i> terminating upon
the surface of the stem in a receding angle; the imperfect
gills few; <i>taste</i> and <i>smell</i> agreeable; <i>spores</i> white.</p>

<p>This Agaric which takes its name from the tree where it is
most commonly found, grows also, though less frequently, on
the Poplar and Beech. Mr. Berkeley reports it rare; perhaps,
however, as it is eminently local, it may here, as in Italy, be
common in some places though of unfrequent general occurrence.
No country being so rich in Elm-trees as our own, we
should probably find <i>A. ulmarius</i> more often if the height at
which it grows among the branches did not frequently screen
it from observation.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Though registered in the Flora of
Tunbridge Wells, I have not met with a single specimen of it
this autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>This Agaric dries well and may be kept (not, however, without
losing some of its aroma) for a long time without spoiling;
the gills, after a time, assume the same hue as the pileus.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“Il a le même goût quo le Champignon de Couche, quoique un peu
plus prononcé.”—<i>Persoon.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> Gregarious; <i>pileus</i> fleshy, loose, of a uniform
brown colour, sometimes marked with dark blotches, as if
burnt; <i>gills</i> nearly free, serrated, at first dirty-white, afterwards
a clear bistre; easily separable from the stalk; <i>stalk</i>
hollow, ventricose, sulcate, rooting, spindle-shaped, slightly
grooved, tapering at the base, sometimes cracked transversely,
varying singularly both in length and breadth.</p>

<p>This excellent fungus is very abundant throughout summer
and autumn, coming up in tufts at the roots of old Oak-trees
after rain. It may be easily recognized by its peculiar spindle-shaped
stalk.</p>

<p>Vittadini does not mention it, nor does its name occur in
the list of esculent funguses in the Diz. di Med. Class.;
notwithstanding which the young plants make an excellent
pickle; while the full-grown ones may be stewed or dressed
in any of the usual modes adopted for the common mushroom.</p>

<p>“La Coucoumèle grise (<i>Ag. vag.</i>) est une des espèces les plus délicates
et les plus sûres à manger.”—<i>De Candolle.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char</i>. “Margin of the pileus sulcate, gills white,
stuffed with cottony pith, fistulose, attenuated upwards, almost
smooth; volva like a sheath. Woods and pastures, August
and October; not uncommon. <i>Pileus</i> four inches or more
broad, plane, slightly depressed in the centre, scarcely umbonate,
fleshy, but not at the extreme margin, which is elegantly
grooved in consequence, viscid when moist, beautifully glossy
when dry; epidermis easily detached, more or less studded
with brown scales, the remnants of the volva, not persistent;
<i>gills</i> free, ventricose, broadest in front, often imbricated,
white; <i>sporules</i> white, round; <i>stem</i> six inches or more high,
from half to an inch thick, attenuated upwards, obtuse at the
base, furnished with a volva, this adnate below to the extent
of an inch, with the base of the stem, closely surrounding it
above as in a sheath, but with the margin sometimes expanded;
within and at the base marked with the groovings of the pileus,
brittle, sericeo-squamulose, scarcely fibrillose, but splitting with
ease longitudinally, hollow, or rather stuffed with fine cottony
fibres; the very base solid, not acrid, insipid. <i>Smell</i> scarcely
any. It occurs of various colours, the more general one is a
mouse-grey” (<i>Berkeley</i>).</p>

<p>The perfect accuracy of the above description will strike
every one familiar with this species. Vittadini speaks of it as
a solitary fungus, but I have found it on more than one occasion
in rings. Its flesh, being very delicate and tender, must
not be over-dressed. When properly fried in butter or oil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and as soon after gathering as possible, the <i>Ag. vaginatus</i> will
be found inferior to but few Agarics in its flavour.</p>

<h3>AGARICUS VIOLACEUS, <i>Linn.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Subgenus 18. <span class="smcap">Inoloma.</span></p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> from four to six inches broad, obtuse,
expanded, covered with soft hairs, colour deep violet; <i>stem</i>
spongy, grey, tinged with violet, minutely downy, about four
inches high; <i>veil</i> fugacious, composed of fine threads; <i>gills</i>
deep violet when young, but turning tawny in age; <i>flesh</i> thick,
juicy.</p>

<p>This is a handsome fungus, not very common, but plentiful
where it occurs; it grows in woods, particularly under Pine
and Fir trees, and may be dressed either with a white or
a brown sauce.</p>

<h3>AGARICUS CASTANEUS, <i>Bull.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Subgenus 19. <span class="smcap">Dermocybe.</span></p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> slightly fleshy, convex when young, at
length umbonate, chestnut colour, from one to three inches
broad, glabrous; <i>gills</i> rather broad, easily detached from the
stem, ventricose, changing from light-purple to a ferruginous
hue; <i>stem</i> rather thin, from one and a half to three inches
long, hollow, silvery, light-lilac or white; <i>veil</i> delicate, composed
of floccose threads; in <i>taste</i>, when raw, it somewhat
resembles the <i>Ag. oreades</i>, but it has no smell.</p>

<p>This <i>Agaric</i> may be distinguished from others by its chestnut
or bistre colour; it is probably not uncommon; growing
all the summer and autumn in woods, and under trees in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
meadows. Mr. Berkeley reports it esculent; I have no experience
of it.</p>

<h3>AGARICUS PIPERATUS, <i>Scop.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Subgenus 7. <span class="smcap">Galorrheus.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“Ed è veramente commestibile e saporoso quando se ne levi il latte.”—<i>Bendiscioli.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> “<i>Pileus</i> infundibuliform, rigid, smooth, white;
gills very narrow, close; milk, and the solid blunt stem, white.
In woods, July and August. <i>Pileus</i> 3-7 inches broad, slightly
rugulose, quite smooth, white, a little clouded with umber, or
stained with yellow where scratched or bruised, convex, more
or less depressed, often quite infundibuliform, more or less
waved, fleshy, thick, firm but brittle; margin involute at first,
sometimes excentric, milk-white, hot. <i>Gills</i> generally very
narrow (1/20 of an inch broad), but sometimes much broader,
cream-colour, repeatedly dichotomous, very close, ‘like the
teeth of an ivory comb,’ decurrent from the shape of the
pileus, when bruised changing to umber. <i>Stem</i> 1-3 inches
high, 1½-2 inches thick, often compressed, minutely pruinose,
solid, but spongy within, the substance breaking up into transverse
cavities.”<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Though very acrid when raw, it loses its bad qualities
entirely by cooking, and is extensively used on the Continent,
prepared in various ways. It is preserved for winter use by
drying or pickling in a mixture of salt and vinegar (<i>Berkeley</i>).</p>

<p>I have frequently eaten this fungus at Lucca, where it is
very abundant, but as it resembles the <i>Ag. vellereus</i> in appearance,
with the properties of which we are unacquainted, too
much caution cannot be exercised in learning to discriminate
it from this and neighbouring species.</p>

<h3>AGARICUS VIRGINEUS, <i>Wullf.</i></h3>

<p class="center">Subgenus 8. <span class="smcap">Clitocybe.</span> Subdivision <span class="smcap">Camarophylli</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>White Field-Agaric.</i></p>

<p><i>Bot. Char.</i> <i>Pileus</i> from one to two inches broad, margin
involute when young, then expanded, depressed in the centre.
<i>Gills</i> deep, connected with veins, sometimes forked, broadly
adnate, but breaking away from the stem as the pileus becomes
depressed. <i>Stem</i> six lines broad at the top, tapering downwards,
not more than two at the base; at first stuffed with
fibres, then hollow, excentric; the whole plant white, with
occasionally a tinge of pink. <i>Taste</i> pleasant, odour disagreeable.</p>

<p>These graceful little Agarics grow in pastures, and are extremely
common in the autumn. They are so small that it
requires a great many of them to make a dish, but as they
occur frequently in the same fields with puff-balls, and may be
dressed in the same manner, it is not unusual when the supply
is scarce to serve them together, with the same sauce. The
flavour of <i>Ag. virgineus</i> is not unlike that of <i>Ag. oreades</i>.</p>

<h3>TUBER ÆSTIVUM, <i>Vitt.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><a href="#plate8"><span class="smcap">Plate VIII. Fig. 2.</span></a></p>

<p>Peridium warty, of a blackish-brown colour, the warts
polygonal and striate, flesh traversed by numerous veins; asci
4-6-spored; spores elliptical, reticulated.</p>

<p>This plant, the common truffle of our markets, is abundant
in Wiltshire and some other parts of England, and probably
occurs in many places where it escapes observation, from its
subterranean habit.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Italy is not the country for the English florist; he will find
twenty times as many petals at home. Trim parterres are
not inventions of the South; summer-houses would be no
luxuries in a climate that never knows winter; the only
Conservatories that flourish there are not for flowers, but
for music. In few northern regions is Flora worse off
for a bouquet than at Rome or Naples; regarded merely
as the herald of Spring and not appreciated for her own
sake, as soon as she has waved her wand over the land
and covered it with the March blossoms of Crocuses, Cyclamens,
and Anemones, her reign is over. All scents are held
in equal abhorrence save those of frankincense and garlic, for
which there seems to be a prescriptive toleration; but every
other odour, fetid or fragrant, musk<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> or mignonette, is equally
proscribed; and an Italian Signora would as soon permit a
Locusta to cook for her, as a violet to scent her boudoir. To
pick wild flowers is as dangerous as it is difficult to find cultivated
ones; a <i>coup de soleil</i> or a fever is easily procured by
imprudent exposure before sunset, while the interval between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that and night is too brief to be employed for the purpose;
but when the season for flowers is long past, and Autumn
with her fruits is come round again, when the stranger can
wander forth where he lists without an umbrella, he will be
able to luxuriate amidst the lovely scenery, and to delight
himself in the natural history of the district: the season of
the periodical rains has ceased; the repose of the forest is no
longer troubled by the Power of the waters; the mountain
Pines borne for miles down into the valleys are stranded on
the broad shingly bed of the exhausted torrent; broken
bridges are safely repaired; the maize is receiving the last
mellowing touches as it festoons the cottage fronts, the
prickly chestnut-pods are beginning to gape and the brown
chestnuts to leap out shining from their envelopes; the last reluctant
olive has been beaten from the bough; the vintage has
nearly ceased to bleed; night fires<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> already begin to nicker on
the mountains, and the hemp stubble is daily crackling on
the plain. This is indeed the time for enjoying Italy; nature
has revived again, and with nature, man. The feverish torpor,
I had almost ventured to call it the summer hybernation, has
ceased with September, and Autumn has come round with
the vivifying influence of a new Spring; then if we go abroad
to wander, whether our walk be across plains or through upland
woods, we shall not stroll a mile without stopping a
hundred times to admire what is to many of us a nearly new
class of objects which have sprung up suddenly and now beset
our path on every side. These are the Fungus tribe, which
are as beautiful as the fairest flowers, and more useful than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
most fruits; and now that butchers’ meat is bad, that the
beans have become stringy, and the potatoes are hydrated by
the rain, they appear thus opportunely to eke out the scantiness
of autumnal larders in the South and give a fresh zest to
the daily repast. Well may their sudden apparition surprise
us, for not ten days since the waters were all out, and only
three or four nights back peals of thunder rattled against the
casements and kept the most determined sleepers in awful
vigil; and now—behold the meadows by natural magic studded
with countless fairy-rings of every diameter, formed of such
species as grow upon the ground, while the Chestnut and the
Oak are teeming with a new class of fruits that had no previous
blossoming, many of which have already attained their
full growth. We recollect with gratitude the objects of a
pursuit, which has accidentally brought us to such an acquaintance
with the diversities of Italian scenery as we never
should have experienced without it. In fishing, it is not the
fish we catch, which alone repays us for our toil; it is the
wandering as the rivulet wanders, “at its own sweet will,”
the exercise and the appetite consequent upon it, the prize in
natural history, the reciting aloud, or reflecting as we walk,
and when it is pleasantly warm the “molles sub arbore
somni,” which console us for the lack of sport. On the same
principle, mushroom-hunting may be recommended to the
young naturalist not only for the beauty of the objects which
he is sure to come upon (if he do but hunt at the right season),
but also because in that most beautiful of months, whether
at home or abroad, it brings the wanderer out of beaten
paths to fall in with many striking views which he would not
otherwise have explored. The extremely limited time during
which funguses are to be found, their fragility, their infinite
diversity, their ephemeral existence, these, too, add to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
interest of an autumnal walk in quest of them. At Lucca,
leaving idleness and indigestion in bed, just as the sun was
beginning to shoot his first rays on the white convents and
the spires of the village churches on the mountains, making
morning above, while the deep valley beneath was still in twilight,
it was pleasant to pass the little opening coffee-house
with its two or three candidates for early breakfast, and crossing
the noiseless trout-stream over the little bridge, to enter
one of those old chestnut-forests and begin clambering up the
laddery pathway, to reach the summit just as he poured his
full effulgence on the magnificent rival of the Lucchese and
Modenese territories. Pleasant, too, was it on the road Romeward,
pausing a few days to enjoy the exquisite scenery about
Spoleto, to climb the steep streets to the cathedral, and thence,
passing the giddy viaduct several hundred feet above the white
ravine which it traverses, to issue upon those Nursian Hills
then fragrant with the breath of morning, “le beau matin qui
sort humide et pâle,” and with the scent of sweet herbs; but
above all other hills renowned for the fragrance of those ever-reproductive
mines of coal-black subterranean truffles! It is
a pleasant remembrance to have plucked the crimson Amanite,
that ministered to a Cæsar’s decease, in the very neighbourhood
of the Palatine Hill; to have collected mushrooms amidst
the meadows of Horace’s farm, where he tells us they grew
best; and to have watched along the moist pastures of the
Cremera a stand of the stately <i>Ag. procerus</i> nodding upon
their stalks; or, standing on the heights above Sorrento, just
as the setting sun flashed upon the waters of the bay ere
they engulfed him, and left us to his sister the evening star,
to have come upon that wonderful <i>Polyporus tuberaster</i> whose
matrix is the hard stone, from which it derives strength and
luxuriance as if from a soft and genial soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>But not only in Italy, in our own country also, the Collector
in Mycology will have to traverse much beautiful and
diversified scenery; amid woods, greenswards, winding lanes,
rich meadows, healthy commons, open downs, the nodding
hop-grove and the mountain sheep-path; and all shone upon
by an autumnal sunset,—as compared with Southern climes
“obscurely bright,” and unpreceded by that beautiful rosy
tint which bathes the whole landscape in Italy, but with a far
finer background of clouds to reflect its departed glories: and
throughout all this range of scenery he will never hunt in
vain; indulgent gamekeepers, made aware of what he is poaching,
may warn him that he is not collecting mushrooms, but
will never warn him off from the best-kept preserves. In
such rambles he will see, what I have this autumn (1847)
myself witnessed, whole <i>hundredweights of rich wholesome diet
rotting under the trees; woods teeming with food and not one
hand to gather it</i>; and this, perhaps, in the midst of potato
blight, poverty and all manner of privations, and public
prayers against imminent famine. I have indeed grieved,
when I reflected on the straitened condition of the lower
orders this year, to see pounds innumerable of extempore
beef-steaks growing on our oaks in the shape of <i>Fistulina
hepatica</i>; <i>Ag. fusipes</i> to pickle, in clusters under them; Puff-balls,
which some of our friends have not inaptly compared to
sweet-bread for the rich delicacy of their unassisted flavour;
<i>Hydna</i> as good as oysters, which they somewhat resemble in
taste; <i>Agaricus deliciosus</i>, reminding us of tender lamb-kidneys;
the beautiful yellow Chantarelle, that <i>kalon kagathon</i> of
diet, growing by the bushel, and no basket but our own to pick
up a few specimens in our way; the sweet nutty-flavoured
<i>Boletus</i>, in vain calling himself <i>edulis</i> where there was none
to believe him; the dainty <i>Orcella</i>; the <i>Ag. heterophyllus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which tastes like the craw-fish when grilled; the <i>Ag. ruber</i>
and <i>Ag. virescens</i>, to cook in any way, and equally good in
all;—these were among the most conspicuous of the <i>trouvailles</i>.
But that the reader may know all he is likely to find
in one single autumn, let him glance at the catalogue below.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
He may at first alarm his friends’ cooks, but their fears will,
I promise him, soon be appeased, after one or two trials of this
new class of viands, and he will not long pass either for a conjuror
or something worse, in giving directions to stew <i>toadstools</i>.
As soon as he is initiated in this class of dainties, he
will, I am persuaded, lose no time in making the discovery
known to the poor of the neighbourhood; while in so doing
he will render an important service to the country at large,
by instructing the indigent and ignorant in the choice of an
ample, wholesome, and excellent article, which they may convert
into money, or consume at their own tables, when properly
prepared, throughout the winter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note on the Arrangement of the spores in Hymenomycetous
Funguses.</span></h3>

<p>On the authority of Link, Fries, Vittadini, and other Continental mycologists,
I have, in speaking of the spores of the genera <i>Agaricus</i>, <i>Boletus</i>, <i>Cantharellus</i>,
<i>Hydnum</i>, and <i>Clavaria</i>, represented them as enclosed in cases (thecæ
or sporanges). But from an interesting memoir, published by Mr. Berkeley
in the ‘Annals of Natural History,’ “On the Fructification of the Pileate and
Clavate tribes of Hymenomycetous Fungi,” which I had not then perused, it
would appear that this arrangement only holds good with respect to <i>Pezizas</i>,
<i>Helvellas</i>, and <i>Morels</i>, and not with respect to the above-mentioned genera,
the spores of which are attached (generally in a quaternary and star form)
to the ends of tubes, to which Mr. Berkeley has given the name of <i>sporophores</i>;
a disposition which, as he observes, had been long ago pointed out by
the great Florentine mycologist, Micheli. M. Montagne, in his ‘Recherches
Anatomiques et Physiologiques sur l’Hymenium,’ while he confirms the fact of
a quaternary disposition of the spores in general, thinks that during the <i>first</i>
stage of their development they are lodged <i>within</i> the sporiferous tubes, to
the mouths of which they afterwards adhere by means of short spiculæ or
branchlets.</p>

<p>These, like all other questions connected with the minute reproductive
granules of funguses, require for their solution not only the most dexterous
manipulation and the aid of the finest modern microscopes, but are likely even
then to exercise the ingenuity of the curious.</p>

they bestow on their esculent vegetation. “Some days since, M. Stanislas
Julien presented to the Academy of Sciences, at Paris, a Chinese work, which
merits a word or two of notice in the present circumstances of agricultural
Europe. It is a treatise, in six volumes, with plates, entitled ‘The Anti-Famine
Herbal;’ and contains the descriptions and representations of four
hundred and fourteen different plants, whose leaves, rinds, stalks, or roots are
fitted to furnish food for the people, when drought, ravages of locusts, or the
overflow of the great rivers have occasioned a failure of rice and grain. Of this
book the Chinese Government annually prints thousands, and distributes them
gratuitously in those districts which are most exposed to natural calamities.
Such an instance of provident solicitude on the part of the Chinese Government
for the suffering classes may be suggestive here at home. A more general
knowledge of the properties and capabilities of esculent plants would be an
important branch of popular education.”—<i>Athenæum</i>, Nov. 16, 1846.</p>

the streets of the Villa de Natividade, I observed some boys amusing themselves
with some luminous object, which I at first supposed to be a kind of
large fire-fly; but, on making inquiry, I found it to be a beautiful phosphorescent
fungus, belonging to the genus <i>Agaricus</i>, and was told that it grew
abundantly in the neighbourhood, on the decaying leaves of a dwarf palm.
Next day I obtained a great many specimens, and found them to vary from
one to two and a half inches across. The whole plant gives out at night a
bright phosphorescent light, of a pale greenish hue, similar to that emitted by
the larger fire-flies, or by those curious, soft-bodied, marine animals, the <i>Pyrosomæ</i>;
from this circumstance, and from growing on a palm, it is called by the
inhabitants ‘Flor do Coco;’ the light given out by a few of these fungi in a
dark room, was sufficient to read by. It proved to be quite a new species, and,
since my return from Brazil, has been described by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley
under the name of <i>Agaricus Gardneri</i>, from preserved specimens which I
brought home.”—<i>Travels in the Interior of Brazil</i>, 1846.</p>

also, in an ancient Italian writer (Cicinelli), that the environs of Padua produce
enormous puff-balls, of which one (unless this author was given to <i>puffing</i>)
measured not less than two feet across, in one direction, being upwards
of a foot and a half in its least diameter. It was big enough, he says, to
have written on its rind the celebrated inscription attributed by Dion Cassius
to the Dacians, which they presented to the Emperor, “in quo scriptum erat
Latinis literis Burros sociosque omnes eum hortari ut domum reverteretur

it used to be made in his time, which indeed was the same as now: the
fungus was first boiled, then beaten to pieces in a mortar, next hammered out
to deprive it of its woody fibres, and lastly, being steeped in a strong solution
of nitre, was left to dry in the sun. It appears, on the testimony of the anonymous
author of the article “Fungo” in the ‘Dizionario Classico di Medicina,’
that it is also eaten when young; but I cannot speak of it from personal experience:—“In

following, which is to be found in old Gerard’s ‘Herbal’:—“Galen affirms that
they (<i>i. e.</i> funguses) are all very cold and moist, and therefore do approach unto
a venomous and mothering facultie, and engender a clammy and pituitous nutriment;
if eaten, therefore, I give my advice unto those that love such strange
and new-fangled meates, to beware of licking honey among thorns, lest the sweetnesse
of the one do not countervaille the sharpnesse and pricking of the other.”</p>

the healthy stomach, than the most dainty viands which have been received
into an organ that is weakened and goaded by a life of dissipation and excess;
but this does not prove sorry fare to be more wholesome than that of a richer
kind. No! Dyspepsia is a disease of the rich; not because they live upon the
fat of the land, but plainly because they indulge in too large a quantity at a
meal. Let the peasant and the lord change places for a week; place the
healthy rustic at the rich man’s table, and Dives again at the other board, what
would be the results to both? Would not the poor man, think you, find indigestion
in ragoût, fricassees, truffles, with light wine <i>ad libitum</i> to drink with
them? and would not the rich man find that the fat pork and hard beer were
worse poison than any of the made-dishes, against which he has been so lavish
in his blame? In general, no doubt, to be “the happiest of mortals—to
digest well” (Voltaire), men should look more to the <i>quantum</i> and less to the
<i>quale</i> of what they eat; but they should pay some attention to this too.</p>

<p>“Giovanna Ballerini, montanara, d’ anni 26, moglie di Luigi Dodici, nativa
di Brugnello, Stato Sardo, e domiciliata in Lardirago, distretto di Belgiojoso,
provincia di Pavia, mangiò la sera del 19 maggio, 1831, in compagnia di due
suoi nipoti, Giuseppe Ballerini d’ anni 6, e Maria, d’ anni 12, buona copia
d’ agarici di primavera, cotti nella minestra. Erano dessi stati colti nel vicin
bosco della Rossa, e da quella sventurata probabilmente scambiati coi Prugnuoli
(<i>Ag. mouceron</i>, Bull.), funghi generalmente conosciuti da quegli alpigiani
sotto il nome di Spinaroli, o Maggenghi. All’ indomani allontanossi Giovanna
da casa, come era suo costume, onde provvedere ai proprj bisogni, ma trascorse
alcune ore venne assalita da forte oppressione all’ epigastrio, da nausee, da
conati di vomito, ecc., e costretta infine verso il meriggio dalla gravezza del
patire a tornarsene a casa, ove trovò dallo stesso male tormentati anche i
nipoti. I principali fenomeni morbosi che presentavano quegli infelici all’
arrivo di Giovanna erano: nausee continue, dolori acutissimi allo stomaco ed
alle intestina, deliquj frequenti, convulsioni, ecc. Poco dopo Maria ed in
seguito Giovanna vennero prese da vomito ostinato di materie bigio-nerastre,
a cui s’accoppiava bentosto, per colmo di sventura, un’ abbondante soccorrenza
della stessa materia, e più innanzi di pretto sangue. Impotente a recere,
Giuseppe si struggeva in vani conati di vomito. Chiamato verso sera in loro
soccorso il sig. dott. Luigi Casorati, medico condotto del luogo, mio collega ed
amico, s’ adoperò ma invano per sostare il vomito ed il colera, che specialmente
in Maria ed in Giovanna andavano sempre più imperversando. Le bevande
mucilaginose, il latte, gli oppiati, le fomentazioni ammollienti sull’ addome a
nulla giovarono. Si tentò la sanguigna, ma anche questa senza effetto. Alle
ore 7 del mattino del giorno 21, 38 ore circa dall’ ingestione del fungo, Giuseppe,
chi si era ostinatamente rifiutato ad ogni medicina, non era più; nè
miglior sorte incontravano Maria e Giovanna, chi, tradotte all’ ospedale di
Pavia, non ostante i soccorsi che vennero loro prodigati, perivano nella stessa
giornata fra le più terribili angosce, e senza perdere gran fatto l’ uso dei sensi,
la prima verso il meriggio, l’ altra verso le ore sette pomeridiane. All’ autopsia
del cadavere di Giuseppe Ballerini, eseguitasi in Lardirago, sotto i miei occhi,
dallo stesso Dottor Casorati che gentilmente me ne fece invito, ed alla quale
assisteva pure il sig. dott. G. Galliotti, si trovò lo stomaco zeppo di un liquido
verdastro, entro cui nuotavano ancora, unitamente a buona porzione di riso e
di erbe, varj pezzetti del fungo non ancora decomposti, e che potei agevolmente
riconoscere a qual parte della pianta appartenessero; la mucosa di quel viscere
sensibilmente injettata, e coperta, specialmente lungo la piccola curvatura ed in
vicinanza del piloro, di grandi macchie di color roseo-livido intenso. Le
intestina tenui pur esse ove più ove meno injettate, e del color dello scarlatto, le
crasse morbosamente ristrette, ma meno delle tenui ingorgate; sì le une che le
altre vuote d’alimenti, e non contenenti che poca quantità di muco bigio-nerastro
e qualche lombrico. Le meningi erano anch’ esse sommamente injettate,
specialmente la pia; la sostanza del cervello meno consistente del naturale,
punteggiata di rosso, e la base dello stesso nuotante in una quantità considerabile
di siero sanguinolento.”—<i>Vitt.</i> p. 340.</p>

and growth, is great; thus, if a number of small Agarics, still in their wrappers,
be placed in wineglasses half filled with water, this will be rapidly absorbed,
even before they break through their membrane. Moreover, if Agarics or
Boletuses, already developed, be placed in glasses containing so many ounces of
water, the amount of which has been previously ascertained, and equal to that
in another glass, by which to make allowance for what has been lost by evaporation,
the result will generally be that a quantity of water, equal to from one-fourth
to one-third of the full weight of each fungus, will have been absorbed
and exhaled again in two days. The redundant moisture of those plants is
rendered conspicuous if we place a Boletus on a watch-glass, the surface of
which is speedily beaded with drops of water, as if it had been in the rain;
while the quantity of fluid is sometimes so great as to defeat the object we had
in placing it there, viz. that of collecting the spores.</p>

bathes the interiors of those little organs, in which the seeds are packed, to be
in other funguses the source of their fecundation. But these at present are

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
